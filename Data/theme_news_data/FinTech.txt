2020.06.21.	코리아중앙데일리	Fintech siphoning top talent from traditional finance firms	From top: Recruitment notice from Kakao Pay. An illustrated image of Naver Account, a cash management account from Naver Financial. [SCREEN CAPTURE]      Fintech companies such as Kakao Pay, Toss and Naver Financial are becoming the next hottest places to work, gobbling up the top talent from major Korean banks and even Silicon Valley.      Professionals in the industry say there's really nothing to lose, considering the competitive salaries, hefty stock options and what many believe to be phenomenal growth potential in the financial tech sector.    Kakao Pay, the payment subsidiary of Kakao, last week opened up 80 new positions, primarily focusing its hiring on experienced software engineers and developers to maintain its mobile payment system. It’s also scouting insurance professionals to head its online-only insurance company.    Previously, Kakao had been in talks with Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance for a joint venture.  The proposal eventually fell through, but the IT giant still plans to offer its own insurance policies.    Kakao Pay’s recruitment notice created some buzz among office workers online. People have been sharing their estimates of the IT giant’s salary, benefits and office culture through anonymous online forums.    Toss Insurance, the insurance arm of Korea’s mobile money transfer service Toss, announced June 16 it will hire 100 insurance managers to sell insurance policies offered through its platform. The fintech company's salary is competitive — 40 million won ($33,000) a year — equivalent to Samsung Electronics' entry-level salary.    Toss will be the first insurance company in Korea to offer permanent contracts, and the first in the industry to offer a stable position for insurance managers. Normally, insurance managers in other Korean companies renew their contracts every year and are compensated based on their sales performances.    Naver Financial, the financial arm of the portal giant Naver, put up a notice last month that it will hire around 50 experienced workers — reportedly resulting in a deluge of resumes sent by top talent not only from commercial banks but from top conglomerates in the country.    Officials say that the vertical decision-making model of companies like Naver might have added appeal to young developers.    “A lot of talented developers we scout from start-ups have a hard time getting used to the strict, conservative and hierarchical decision-making process of the finance industry,” said a high-ranking official from the finance industry, who wished to remain anonymous to answer frankly. “It makes sense that developers would seek out companies where the leadership allows developers to freely try out their ideas.”    Such vacuuming of talent is not only for tech giants like Naver and Kakao. Financial tech start-ups like Banksalad are scouting IT professionals from Silicon Valley, promising rosy visions for the future.    Start-up Rainist, the operator of the asset management app Banksalad said it scouted four developers from the headquarters of international tech giants like Airbnb and Facebook. While the four people were offered juicy deals from other big players, they decided to stay with Banksalad, drawn in by the proactive working environment of a start-up.    “Many of the new developers were attracted to our data-driven business model and autonomous working environment,” said an official from the company.    The fintech industry is highly attractive, especially to millennials in their 20s and 30s, due to its massive growth potential and relatively liberal working environment. As more tech companies expand into the finance, banking and insurance businesses, the financial industry is seeing more of its talent knocking on the doors of tech companies.    The exceptionally competitive benefits these companies offer is another factor. Viva Republica, the operator of Toss, took the internet by storm for offering close to double the salary from their previous jobs and some 100 million won in stock options for experienced hires.    “There’s really no reason to reject a job offer from a company that has less hierarchy and better pay,” said an official from the fintech industry.    The fintech industry has also caught the eyes of fresh graduates. According to a survey from job portal Incruit, Kakao Bank was No. 1 among 1,045 university students as the most desirable bank to work at. Students pointed out Kakao Bank’s “growth potential” and “work and life balance” as the two most attractive aspects of the company.    Traditional banks are on red alert to retain talent.    “IT specialists will become more valuable as time passes for the finance industry. We are worried that the fintech industry will vacuum up all the best talent,” said an official from one commercial bank. “The finance industry needs to change from its rigid working culture into a more flexible one to prepare for the future."

2020.06.23.	코리아헤럴드	[News Focus] Tokyo’s bid to replace HK threatens Seoul’s dream of becoming financial hub	Office buildings of South Korean brokerage houses in Yeouido, Seoul (Yonhap)Turning Seoul into a new financial hub in Asia has for long been a campaign promise of local politicians cutting across party lines.Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, who is now in his third term, is no exception. He had even announced plans to replace old apartment buildings with high-rises of up to 50 stories and create more parks and leisure spaces to reinvigorate the city’s financial district Yeouido. But the city’s progress in realizing these yearslong dream is being questioned as its neighboring rival Tokyo is making all-out efforts to promote itself as an alternative to Hong Kong.According to the Financial Times, Tokyo -- in cooperation with its central government ministries and financial authorities -- is considering offering various benefits such as short-term visa waivers, tax advice and free office space for Hong Kong financiers who are seeking to shift base due to the prolonged social instability as a result of Beijing’s proposed national security law.While Tokyo wants to capitalize on the opportunity to replace Hong Kong, the former British colony -- which has maintained its status as Asia’s leading financial center for decades -- Seoul seems to lack solid, effective plans to entice professionals and institutions wanting to relocate.The Seoul government, for its part, has said it is making efforts to attract foreign investors by offering free offices. But the plan is mainly for small fintech companies. 　“We’ve been making efforts to attract overseas firms by providing free office space, patent and regulation consulting and network-building via the Seoul fintech lab, located in Yeouido,” said a government official in charge of the city’s financial industry. Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, the city was gearing up to kick off its overseas investor relations events in the first half of this year, but they had to be postponed, the official said. The city laid part of the blame on the nation’s corporate tax laws, with high tax rates in Seoul because it is categorized as an overpopulated area. “We are aware of the incentives that overseas big players look forward to. We’d like to lower corporate taxes as well, but due to its location Seoul cannot provide better benefits.” Instead, the city will attempt to attract more financial players from abroad by opening a new office in Yeouido in October, tentatively named the “Seoul Office,” and launch a website to provide information in different languages on the nation’s major financial regulations, the official added.Given the circumstances, some experts say Seoul is not ready to be Asia’s next preferred financial center, on par with Hong Kong, considering the size of the domestic economy and the lack of freedom for financial activities here. “Since the UK has retained the top spot as a financial hub, it’s understandable that Hong Kong’s big players are fleeing there. Singapore and Tokyo face difficulties such as the small market size and financial regulations, but they have surely emerged as prime alternatives,” Sung Tae-yoon, an economics professor at Yonsei University, said. “Compared to the two cities, Seoul’s conditions are even worse. The current size of the domestic economy is relatively smaller than Singapore and our financial regulations are stricter than that of Japan. For now, it seems difficult to promote Seoul as an alternative to Hong Kong, unless it improves its standards,” he added, suggesting that the city should seek practical ways to reduce the burden of overseas investors in the financial sector.A survey conducted by London-based think tank Z/Yen Group in March showed that London and Tokyo were still in second and third place, respectively, while Seoul ranked No. 33 as a financial center. The Global Financial Centers Index rated 108 financial centers, combining assessments from finance sector professionals with data.Seoul was designated as a financial center in January 2009 as part of the city’s drive to lure big financial players from abroad. Mayor Park also announced last year that he would secure the financial district of Yeouido to emerge as a fintech hub, but with no substantial achievement made so far.Hong Kong appears to be less favorable to attract talent now, said a hedge fund manager based in the city, citing growing the instability that undermines the overall living environment. “Hong Kong is losing its luster and I see many (financiers) are planning to move to other countries like the UK and Singapore,” he said, on condition of anonymity.“Smart people can go anywhere, regardless of (the level of) infrastructure. But even if Seoul wants (to be an alternative to Hong Kong), language still remains a big hurdle, more than anything else.”By Jie Ye-eun (yeeun@heraldcorp.com)[네이버에서 코리아헤럴드 구독]▶ KH Podcast     ▶ KH Video<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000219357
2020.06.14.	코리아헤럴드	[Banks of Future] Security concerns overshadow fast-growing fintech industry	(Toss)Recent unauthorized payments on money transfer platform Toss are stoking concerns about the safety of payment solutions in general and online financial services available in South Korea. Online purchases worth 9.38 million ($7,770) were made on websites without permission of Toss account holders earlier this month using their personal data. Although initial inspections by the financial authority showed that users’ personal data were not compromised via the fintech platform itself, the incident shed light on the security of similar services, including those run by online platform operators Naver, Kakao, and NHN.“After the incident, I realized that any smartphone user can fall victim to such unauthorized transactions without knowing it,” said a 30-year-old fintech service user, adding “I may have to be more cautious when using mobile financial services for a while.”Although the personal data used was not stolen through Toss, Viva Republica has taken a lot of flak due to the unauthorized transactions. The Toss platform, which focuses on convenience, only requires a user’s personal identification number when verifying the account owner before processing online payments. Users of some other payment services, on the other hand, have to go through one or more additional steps for authentication. Viva Republica said that it has added additional security measures for verifying account holders since the online theft case, and that is fully cooperating with the police and financial authorities to find who illegally gained the personal data."The problematic payments were an unusual case that took place at just a few websites, and it has already beefed up all of its systems with more layers of user verification" an official from the fintech startup said.Personal data can be leaked through different ways, including via access to compromised Wi-Fi networks and downloads of programs that contain malicious code, according to experts.“The thing is, it is hard to track down who illegally gained access to the personal data,” an official from the data security sector said. Unauthorized transactions are also a headache for many global payment services such as PayPal. Although the exact statistics are not available, hackers who have illegally obtained user data make payments via such payment services.Local fintech services providers have been paying keen attention to the latest case of unauthorized payments on Toss. Naver and NHN, respectively, run mobile payment services N Pay and Payco while Kakao owns its own fintech solution Kakao Pay. E-commerce giants Shinsegae and Lotte operate payment services of their own.“Kakao Pay has long maintained data protection policies, such as tokenization of personal data and strict limits on access to personal information,” said an official from the subsidiary of mobile messenger firm Kakao.NHN also said that it was taking extra precautions in the entire payment process and monitoring and analyzing the latest hacking attempts.The Financial Supervisory Service has hinted that it would review the security systems of some 40 payment services in the nation, if necessary.By Kim Young-won (wone0102@heraldcorp.com)[네이버에서 코리아헤럴드 구독]▶ KH Podcast     ▶ KH Video<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000219075

2020.06.10.	코리아헤럴드	FSS plans to review security of fintech solutions due to unauthorized payments on Toss	Viva Republica’s money transfer app Toss. (Viva Republica)The alleged hacking of Toss, an online money transfer platform operated by fintech startup Viva Republica, is likely to trigger extensive inspections of similar solutions by the financial watchdog.“We plan to conduct reviews of fintech systems that adopt payment technology similar to Toss, if necessary,” an official from the Financial Supervisory Service said. “Some 40 companies could be subject to such inspections,” the official added.The Seoul-based startup said earlier this week that a total of eight unauthorized payments were made via its customers’ accounts. The amount of the payments, worth some 9.4 million won ($7,900), is relatively small, but the latest case could dampen excitement in the fintech industry, which has been garnering growth momentum thanks to the government’s support policies and customers’ growing preference for contactless services amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Viva Republica said the account owners’ data had not seemingly been leaked via the Toss platform since personal identification numbers, among other data points including names and dates of birth, are not stored in the company’s servers. It delivered compensation to the eight victims right after it discovered the records of the unauthorized transactions.The company has been criticized for belatedly announcing the alleged hacking case. The incident took place on June 3, but it publicly announced the case six days later.Upon news on possible inspections by the FSS, Viva Republica said that it would “fully cooperate to find out who had illegally stolen the personal data.”Established in 2011, it is the first fintech startup to achieve unicorn status --- valuation of over $1 billion. Viva Republica is valued at $2.2 billion.The company has received a preliminary license to run an online-only bank here, and aims to launch it as early as this year.By Kim Young-won (wone0102@heraldcorp.com)[네이버에서 코리아헤럴드 구독]▶ KH Podcast     ▶ KH Video<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000219001

2020.06.11.	연합뉴스	[PRNewswire] Huawei Empowers Global Financial Customers' Digital	Transformation with Mobile-Centric Strategy and Cloud, AI, and 5G Capabilities-- Huawei Holds Global FSI Summit 2020 online(SHENZHEN, China, June 10, 2020 PRNewswire=연합뉴스) Today, Huawei held its Global FSI Summit 2020 (online overseas part) with the theme of "Thrive Digitally in a Mobile Future." Financial institutions and enterprises were invited to share their experience and insights in dealing with the "new normal" in the post-pandemic era, involving accelerated mobile first implementation and using FinTech to ensure business continuity and reshape financial services models. Huawei believes that mobile capabilities are key to future banks. Supporting this mobile-centric business will require new IT architectures and key capabilities of cloud, AI and 5G. As a leading tech player, Huawei provides its global financial customers with competitive financial ICT solutions, and works with various world-leading partners on joint innovation.The summit attracted the world's leading financial institutions including Shanghai Pudong Development (SPD) Bank, China Construction Bank, Singapore DBS Bank, Sberbank, BBVA, Isbank; the world's leading financial solutions provider Temenos, and analyst institutions IDC and other global industry participants.Financial Institutions that Adhere to the Mobile First Strategy and Going Digital Will achieve Greater SuccessThe COVID-19 pandemic has advanced digital operations in the financial industry with more confidence and determination in such implementation. Moreover, the industry has demonstrated its advantages and value in applying new technologies in digital operations.Peng Zhongyang, Director of the Board, President of the Enterprise Business Group, Huawei, stated: "Based on cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, 5G, and other ICT technologies, innovative FinTech will embrace new opportunities and lead the upgrade of financial services. We have combined our 30 years of technical experience, capabilities, and industry insights with customer needs, to provide competitive financial ICT products and solutions that span multiple domains, and collaborate with various partners for joint innovation. We believe that financial institutions that are ready to go digital will probably see greater success."Adhering to the "mobile first" principle to achieve smart experience is the foundation for financial institutions' customer-centric business strategies, said Jason Cao, President of Global Financial Services Business Unit, Enterprise BG, Huawei. "We do believe that the mobile capability will be the core of the future of the banking industry. It not only is applicable to the interface that connects with client, but also to the internal operations and collaborations with partners. Supporting this mobile-centric business will require new IT architectures and key capabilities of 5G, AI and cloud. As a leader of these technologies, Huawei has unique advantages that supports the cloud transformation of financial institutions, builds new connecting capabilities, and helps financial institutions improve their agility and innovation capabilities," he explained.The Transformation Experience of Banks in China Empowers the Global Financial Services IndustryOver the past 10 years, Huawei has accumulated extensive experience globally. Particularly in China market, Huawei has gained experience in leading banks' transformation and thriving in the mobile App era. Notably, the banking sector has taken a series of measures to ensure business continuity in different stages of the pandemic. In the post-pandemic era, banks need to proactively reflect on their business model and prepare for any uncertainties in order to ensure an agile business moving forward.Shanghai Pudong Development (SPD) Bank has applied technologies such as 5G, IoT, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing since 2018. At the beginning of this year, our bank established a three-year action plan, aiming to strengthen open banking, promote full-stack digitalization, and create new development drivers by focusing on customer experience and digital technology. From the strategic perspective, we will promote data operations, technology upgrade, and cross-industry collaboration. For example, SPD Bank has developed an AI-powered virtual employee, Xiaopu. Through professional training, Xiaopu is capable of offering risk assessment, financial consulting, investment advice, and news broadcast services online. In the 5G environment, she can work perfectly on various devices such as mobile phones, smart watches, and cars, making high-quality, personalized, and intelligent services more convenient and inclusive.Pan Weidong, President of SPD Bank, expressed in his keynote speech: "Adhering to 'customer-centricity', SPD Bank uses 5G and other technologies to continuously innovate customer experience, business models, and open ecosystems, and expand the breadth, depth, and width of financial services. We will strengthen cross-industry cooperation and innovation. We want to create infinite possibilities with connections, inspire infinite momentum with intelligence, serve the industry ecosystem with FinTech, and jointly promote high-quality social and economic development to embrace a better future."China Construction Bank (CCB) launched the "TOP+" strategy for financial digital transformation as early as 2011. It uses technology and data as a two-wheel drive to actively embrace new technologies such as AI, blockchain, cloud computing, and 5G, and embed financial services into the four essential sectors, namely, clothing, food, housing and transportation. During the pandemic, the application of new technologies allows CCB to provide customers with "no-contact services" correspondingly. An online loans channel, for example, is set timely to meet customer's financial needs. In early February, the bank launched a comprehensive service of "anti-epidemic zone" through mobile banking and WeChat Bank, providing real-time data on the epidemic situation, application for late personal loan repayment, charitable donations and other services.Niu Wenchao, Senior Engineer of China Construction Bank, said at the summit: "During the epidemic, while the over-the-counter transactions decreased significantly, CCB's online transactions increased slightly. Thanks to CCB's dual cloud strategy, the private cloud provides stable operations and public cloud assists innovation and development. More importantly, we rely on the intelligent data center infrastructure and the highly automated and intelligent network jointly built by Huawei and CCB. Digital transformation has laid the foundation for us to quickly respond to emergencies and maintain continuity of customer services."Huawei's Data Infrastructure Stimulates Digital Transformation in the Financial Sector to Address Mobile ChallengesA strong and powerful real-time connectivity is of the essence when the banking sector enters the digital world, and 5G, IoT, and a flexible network are key technologies.Accelerated data infrastructure enables future banking. Joy Huang, Chief Strategy Officer, Cloud & AI BG, Huawei, thinks some banks have a sustaining robust growth because of digital technologies. These growing companies have one thing in common, that is their good online services capabilities based on cloud, so that they can be very agile in innovation. Huawei learns from customers that the most effective way is to practice multi-cloud, with separate clouds for different users, and meanwhile pay close attention to customers' last-mile experience for mobile services and smart branches.User experience improvement of financial Apps is an important part of digital transformation. Siri Borsum, VP of Finance Vertical, Global Partnerships & Eco-Development, Consumer BG, Huawei, commented: "Huawei's large number of device users, strong HMS capabilities, rich market resources, offline retail resources, and global human resources will help our partners serve users better and improve user experience of mobile Apps."Network connectivity is one of the core components of the financial data infrastructure. Daniel Tang, CTO of Data Communications Product Line, Huawei, said: "Huawei's comprehensively upgraded CloudFabric 2.0 data center network solution, through the high-density 400GE intelligent ultra-wide, zero packet loss intelligent connection and Support differentiated capabilities such as intelligent operation and maintenance of autonomous driving networks, lead the data center network into the intelligent era, help financial institutions build full-scale financial services, and enhance mobile user experience."Huawei helps financial institutions digitally transform in terms of inclusive finance, data-driven business innovation, open banking, and providing customers with inclusive, stable, secure, and convenient financial services. To date, Huawei has served more than 1,600 financial institutions worldwide, including 45 of the world's top 100 banks. In addition, it has established comprehensive strategic collaboration with 20 large-scale banks, insurers, and securities companies around the world, and has become a trusted strategic partner for customers' digital transformation.Huawei's Global FSI Summit is a global ICT event hosted by Huawei and focused on the financial services industry. The event was first held in 2013 and all attendees are industry elites from financial institutions.

2020.05.04.	코리아헤럴드	[Market Close-Up] How traditional banks can survive in the fintech era	Experts warn commercial lenders to diversity revenue sources, seek ways to coexist with fintechs, Big TechsHana Bank headquarters in central Seoul (Yonhap)Competition between traditional banks and fintech or Big Tech companies, such as Kakao, is set to heat up further as the financial authorities clear away hurdles to new projects.In this new environment, traditional lenders will be required to diversify their revenue sources -- from interest on loans to commissions and trusts -- to keep their heads above water in the financial market, officials and experts here say.“With the digitalization of the global economy and the expansion of e-commerce, Big Tech and fintech companies are emerging as rivals of traditional banks,” a report published by analysts at the Bank of Korea showed April 27.“Of them, the Big Tech firms will become a direct threat to traditional banks due to their capacity to develop customized financial products via analysis of user data compiled through their other services and e-commerce platforms,” it added. Big Tech and major fintech firms have slowly expanded their presence in the financial sector in recent months, with the backing of the authorities. Internet-only Kakao Bank and financial service app Toss both partnered up with local card issuers this month to offer credit card services for the first time. They highlighted their ability to offer tailored services to customers by making use of big data. Thanks to big data, Kakao Bank simplified the credit card application process. Kakao Bank users are required only to submit basic information on the bank app and receive their cards almost immediately, whereas traditional issuers ask for several stages of certification. Kakao Bank partnered with the credit card units of institutions such as Shinhan, KB Kookmin, Samsung and Citibank. Kakao Bank had 12 million users as of end-March and has opened 20,000 to 30,000 new accounts every month so far, according to the lender. Toss, which has maintained around 16 million users since last year, partnered with Hana Card to offer its credit card service. It received 200,000 applications in the two weeks starting April 9. For traditional credit card issuers, receiving 300,000 applications a year is considered a success story. Such partnerships may signal the start of a virtuous partnership between tech firms and traditional institutions, some say, but it has also prompted concerns. It reflects the traditional financial institutions’ growing reliance on large tech groups, which have a large, stable customer base that seeks to take advantage of the interconnected services that tech giants can offer, according to others. And their strong user base not only reflects customers’ preference for financial services provided by tech groups, but growing trust in those groups as well. “Basically, traditional institutions need to find a way to offer products or services in a customer-centered perspective -- fintech groups are catching up with old institutions in terms of customer trust, while having the upper hand in cost efficiency,” an analyst at the Hana Institute of Finance said. Alongside calls for further digitalization and more customer-oriented services, experts stressed the need for traditional banks to diversify their profit sources.  Kakao Bank’s credit card, launched in partnership with Shinhan Card (Kakao Bank)South Korea’s traditional banking sector continues to rely heavily on profit from interest, despite a low-growth, low-interest environment, the BOK report noted. “Local banks continue to maintain a profit model that relies on income from interest and this is limiting growth in profitability for them amid a low-growth, low-interest environment,” the report said. “They face restrictions in cost, workforce and governance structure to see tangible results in digitalization as global banks are investing heavily in digital transformation.”Analysts said the financial authorities needed to balance support for fintech and Big Tech groups with a continued interest in traditional institutions. The policymaking Financial Services Commission said last month that it was currently reviewing plans to allow traditional financial institutions to operate online platforms such as those facilitating e-commerce and food delivery. Kakao and Viva Republica, operator of Toss, meanwhile, continue their foray into uncharted territory. Kakao won FSC approval earlier this year to launch a new brokerage business, and Viva Republica won preliminary approval to do the same. Toss also plans to launch its own internet-only bank soon, having gained preliminary approval from the FSC to do so in December last year.

2020.06.07.	코리아헤럴드	[Banks of Future] Virtual banks come of age in COVID-19 era	Amid the lingering virus pandemic, South Korea’s online banks are expanding their foothold faster than expected, and are gearing up for IPOs and partnerships with financial behemoths.(Clockwise) Fintech startup Viva Republica CEO Lee Seung-gun, Naver Financial Group CEO Choi In-hyuk, K bank CEO Lee Moon-hwan and Kakao Bank CEO Yoon Ho-young (Yonhap and respective companies)The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on South Korea’s fast-growing online-only banks and fintech firms facing opportunities and challenges. This is the first installment. -- Ed.Virtual banks that have no physical presence but offer immediate services online have been touted as banks of the future in recent years, despite resistance from traditional players. Labeling them as financial services of the future seems far-fetched. In recent months, they have grown faster than anticipated -- though not sure if it’s good or bad –- due to the COVID-19 pandemic.In a world where things may never be the same, online-only banks are striving for financial innovation, seeking to go beyond the domain of established players that have built strong customer confidence over decades.On proliferating demand for contactless services across industries and the South Korean government ‘s drive to nurture new businesses to spur economic growth, online banks are now enjoying an unexpected opportunity to expand their operations, and take the next step forward to become a dominant force in the retail finance sector.Money transfer or saving accounts are, so far, the only services online banks can offer. But enjoying growing interest and investment, online-only banks and homegrown fintech companies that boast technological prowess are set to test their limits.Among the companies that have recently been put on the fintech map are portal operators Kakao and Naver, both of which are fast expanding their presence in the realm.Their emergence is in line with the government’s new policies to nurture internet-only banks, which allow nonfinancial companies to own up to 34 percent of an online bank. Concerned over excessive influence of conglomerates in the financial market, the government had long banned nonfinancial companies to hold more than a 4 percent stake in financial firms before the new online-only bank rules were set up in August, 2018.With the eased regulations, Kakao Bank, founded in 2017, made a turnaround last year with its net profit standing at 13.7 billion won. Backed by the nation’s largest mobile messenger firm Kakao, the online bank’s subscriber base has surpassed 12 million, which is more than a fifth of the nation’s entire population. The number of monthly active users exceeded 10 million -- the largest among banking apps available in the nation. “By offering user-friendly services and benefits, Kakao Bank will try to become customers’ go-to bank,” said Yoon Ho-young, CEO of Kakao’s banking unit, in an online media event late last month. He said the company was preparing to go public, but refused to give details on the exact schedule.“The firm’s planned initial public offering will be aimed at raising capital to achieve sustainable growth,” he said.The combined market share of Kakao Bank and its rival K bank is still relatively small, at 2.3 percent, but they are considered to have gained growth momentum in earnest with the widespread of contactless financial services, according to experts. “Internet and mobile financial services will further gather steam with ‘contactless’ being widely accepted in a range of areas,” said Yoon Kyeong-soo, a researcher at the KDB Future Strategy Institute of the state-owned Korea Development Bank.K bank, which was founded just several months before Kakao Bank, has been struggling since it was blocked from raising new funds from its major shareholder, KT, which was accused of violating the antitrust law here. The local law does not allow a conglomerate if found to have breached antitrust rules, to become the largest stakeholder of a financial firm.The nation’s first online-only bank saw a silver-lining earlier this year as the government relaxed the rules. Its synergies with the telecom company, not just its vast subscriber network but also KT’s competitive edge as a technology firm, is what K bank wants to differentiate itself from its peers. “K bank has developed a credit rating model by utilizing consumers’ financial and telecommunications data, which helps even financially marginalized people to use banking services and products, such as loans,” said Kim Dong-woo, a spokesperson, adding “It will keep focusing on deploying network technology to offer values for customers.”(Clockwise) Fintech startup Viva Republica CEO Lee Seung-gun, Naver Financial Group CEO Choi In-hyuk, K bank CEO Lee Moon-hwan and Kakao Bank CEO Yoon Ho-young (Yonhap and respective companies)Vying for market leadershipThe competition to take the lion’s share in the online-only banking market is expected to heat up with more companies throwing their hats in the ring. After obtaining a preliminary license to run an internet bank, Viva Republica, a fintech unicorn that runs Venmo-like money transfer platform Toss, is preparing to start online bank operations in the latter half this year.“How well those companies manage to create synergies with affiliates and partners and utilize technology will decide who will become a winner or loser in the internet-only bank sector down the road,” Yoon said. Buoyed by high demand for contactless services and the government’s drive to nurture fintech industry, Viva Republica, turned a profit for the first time in April since the platform was launched in April, 2015.The monthly remittances via Toss reach 4.5 trillion won while the accumulated volume comes in at some 90 trillion won. Around 17 million subscribe to the platform. Riding wave, the Seoul-based startup, founded in 2011, plans on another fundraising round in a bid to attract as much as $200 million. It has so far raised a total of $350 million in previous funding rounds. Along with its growing user base and improving profits, the Seoul-based startup’s market valuation rose from 130 billion in 2017 to 2.7 trillion won in 2019.Viva Republica CEO Lee Seung-gun is also painting a big picture to take the company to the next level in the coming years.“The company is considering to issue initial public offerings in two to three years in developed markets,” said CEO Lee, adding “It will try to use profits from the Toss platform to fund new businesses, including internet banking, securities, and payment gateway.” The company is forecast to go public either in Korea, Hong Kong or the US. Unique marketing, partnershipHaving financial subsidiary Naver Financial Group under its wings, Naver is posing a challenge against both conventional financial firms and existing fintech companies. Its biggest weapon in the fintech battle is its formidable presence in the local online industry. Although its influence in the internet realm has shrunk due to growing presence of global search engines and SNS platforms, such as Google and YouTube, in recent years, the Korean portal giant still dominates more than 70 percent of the local search engine market. In combination with its e-commerce and payment services, among others, Naver will likely cause significant ripples in the financial segment, market watchers said. “Together with Naver’s e-commerce and membership services, its planned savings account product that will offer a higher interest rate than offline commercial banks give will have competitive edge,” said a source from the banking industry.It recently launched a subscription-based premium membership program that offers subscribers financial rewards for using webtoon, livestreaming music and video, and cloud services.Along with the online banking services, fast-growing mobile payment and financial data aggregation services will accelerate change in the overall financial sector, which has long been depicted as ‘conservative’, and ‘rigid,’ according to market officials. “As user-friendly apps and services have started to gain popularity, traditional banks have followed suit by rolling out similar products,” said an official from the local fintech sector, adding that “large financial companies may have to pay keen attention to fast-changing trends in order not to be outrun by tech-savvy players.”Not to be outpaced, traditional banks and card companies are willing to partner up with emerging fintech companies. For example, Woori Bank, a leading commercial bank here, and Viva Republica together have developed a system that allows users to compared loan products online. The current government’s supportive measures for fintech companies are also expected to accelerate the entry of new market players as well, according to market watchers. The government, for example, runs a consulting program for fledgling fintech startups to lower or remove unnecessary regulatory hurdles.By Kim Young-won (wone0102@heraldcorp.com)[네이버에서 코리아헤럴드 구독]▶ KH Podcast     ▶ KH Video<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000218886

2020.05.19.	코리아헤럴드	Fintech groups set to thrive in e-signature market	Kakao Pay`s e-verification service (Kakao Pay)With the National Assembly likely to pass revisions to the Electronic Signature Act on Wednesday, fintech groups and mobile carriers are projected to dominate the related market with their existing online identification services. The revision bill -- likely to be among a set of legislations that the 20th National Assembly will pass at its last plenary meeting –- is projected to fuel privatization of the e-signature industry by abolishing the nation’s public e-certificate system, also known as the accredited certificate of authentication. The accredited certificate, which has been used here widely for more than two decades, has been often criticized for its complicated and grueling application and issuance process. On top of it, foreign residents here were not eligible for application and the certificate had one-year expiration date, which required users to repeat the same issuance process every year. With the abolishment of the public certificate, its users are expected to flock to private e-signature systems operated or developed by local fintech firms. Fintech firms wield the power and technology, such as blockchain technology to bolster the systems’ security. Kakao Pay, mobile payment services unit of Korean IT giant Kakao, launched its own e-certification service in 2017 and has already garnered more than 10 million users as of early May. Like the public certificate system, it uses the framework of public key infrastructure which utilizes encryption and cybersecurity that protects communication between the server and the client. But the security was further bolstered through blockchain technology. The application and issuance process is also carried out through Kakao’s mobile messenger app Kakao Talk for convenience. Pass, an identity verification service and mobile app offered to users of all major mobile carriers -- SK Telecom, KT and LG Uplus –- also launched its verification system last year. Companies such as KT and Mirae Asset have adopted it for their official verification system since. The system allows users to have their identity verified by fingerprint or iris or by inputting a six-digit password instead of filing in extensive personal information. Its technology developed by Aton, a local security company specializing in fintech, a sign that the abolishment of the public certification system will open more opportunities for small and medium-sized fintech firms that can participate as developers. Traditional lenders have their own joint e-verification system as well, which follows the footsteps of the public system, but boasts an expiration date of three years.

2020.06.08.	매경닷컴	Korean govt mulls allowing up to $830 later-pay option for fintech platforms	The South Korean government is considering stretching the ceiling for simple payment on online platforms like Naver and Kakao up to 1 million won ($830) from previously discussed monthly cap of 300,000 won to 600,000 won.The Financial Services Commission is revising the electronic banking law to give simple payment users a pay-later option after announcing the measure in February, according to sources from the financial industry on Sunday.Currently, the later payment is limited to companies with equity capital of 20 billion won or above, but the financial authority is set to allow the option for fintech firms that can provide simple payment service if their equity capital exceeds just 2 billion won.The simple payment platforms have been asking for the law revision to expand their scope of services. Kakao Pay CEO Ryu Young-joon urged the government last year to permit the option to enable consumers to pay for public transportation without a plastic. The financial authority expects the easing of the regulation would boost growth of the fintech market. Last year, the daily simple payment transaction volume averaged 174.5 billion won. The government is mulling upping the later pay limit after the country’s three mobile carriers raised the monthly ceiling of their micro payment services from 600,000 won to 1 million won, according to sources.But some worry that the revision virtually allows credit-financing to fintech companies and adds personal debt increase as the later-pay option is basically based on consumers’ credit like a credit card. Credit card companies also complained that it is a special treatment for fintech firms because they should acquire a license to start a lending business.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=009&aid=0004590966

2020.06.09.	코리아헤럴드	Viva Republica allegedly targeted by hackers	Viva Republica CEO Lee Seung-gun (Yonhap)Viva Republica, which runs the money transfer platform Toss, says it has been targeted by hackers, raising alarm over its security system. According to the fintech firm, eight unauthorized purchases worth a total of 9.4 million won ($7,853) were made via Toss on June 3 from three online websites. Data such as names, phone numbers, birth dates and personal identification numbers were compromised in the incident, but it is “highly unlikely” they were leaked via the Toss platform since they are not stored in its servers, the fintech firm said.“The company gave compensation to eight victims right after the records of the unauthorized transactions were discovered,” said an official from Viva Republica.“We will fully cooperate with the police and related agencies to find out who illegally gained access to the data.”Although it pleaded innocence, the company vowed that it would beef up its security system to prevent any future hacking or attempts to use stolen personal data.Established in 2011, the online bank is the first fintech startup to achieve unicorn status, meaning it is worth at least $1 billion. Viva Republica is deemed to be valued at $2.2 billion. The company has received a preliminary license to run an online-only bank here, and aims to launch it as early as this year.

The FSC decided to hold the event, its second since 2019, online because of the coronavirus pandemic. [SCREEN CAPTURE]       Financial Services Commission (FSC) Chairman Eun Sung-soo promised to focus capital on industries and companies that will lead digital fintech innovation.      “We will particularly expand investments in fourth industrial revolution areas that will be the foundation of the Digital New Deal, including 5G, artificial intelligence [AI] and big data,” Eun said Thursday in opening remarks for the financial authority’s Korea Fintech Week that were played online.      “We will aggressively support the three new growth engines — system semiconductors, biohealth and future cars — as well as fintech, innovative ventures and start-ups,” the FSC chairman said.      In the face of the unprecedented economic crisis triggered by the pandemic, the Moon Jae-in government has announced a so-called Korean New Deal, whose blue print is to be announced next month.        The Korean New Deal is meant to pinpoint growth engines that would drive Korea’s economy in the post coronavirus era and contributes to creating sustainable new jobs, especially for young people.      “Covid-19 has not only changed the global order, the economic and social structure, but fundamentally changed our daily lives,” Eun said.      “A rearrangement of the global supply chain and industrial structure is being triggered while the digitalization of the economy and society is speeding up,” he added. “I forecast that we will not be able to return to the way we were.”      He said working at home, virtual meetings and non-contact transactions are growing.      “Our children are attending class on-line,” he said.      “Physical isolation from each other and hyper-connections based on networks are getting stronger,” Eun said. “Convergence and innovation through data and platforms and the speed of the fourth industrial revolution is getting faster.    Image captured of the fintech companies participating in FSC's virtual Korea Fintech Week exhibition. [SCREEN CAPTURE] “As a result I believe a new order and standard will be formed.”      Eun said the government is working on innovative strategies that will help the country not only overcome the coronavirus crisis but also help it lead the digital economy.      He said the government will push for regulatory changes and improvement in infrastructure, including three data laws that were approved by the National Assembly at the beginning of this year.    The three pieces of legislation — the Personal Information Protection Act, Information and     Communications Network Act and Protection of Credit Information Act — relaxed restrictions including access to personal data that inhibited start-ups from coming up with new services.      “Through the financial regulatory sandbox, we will create a testbed for convergences of fourth industrial revolution technologies and [traditional] finance,” Eun said.            This year Korea Fintech Week was held online because of the ongoing pandemic.      Those attending included William Russell, Lord Mayor of the City of London, and Bill Winters, Standard Chartered CEO.      According to the FSC, 150 companies attended the event, which is being displayed in six virtual exhibition halls, while several special sessions were held on various subjects including the future of fintech in the post Covid-19 era.      A virtual job fair was held with human resources figures from 35 financial companies taking part.

The credit card company expects it to be closed by the end of 2020.J Fintech is a financial subsidiary of mobile phone distributor Jay Mart. Engaging in the business of lending money under the brand “J Money,” collecting bad debt and writing off nonperforming loans, J Fintech recorded a 67 million baht net profit in 2019. Jay Mart currently holds 95.65 percent of shares in J Fintech. KB Kookmin Card will buy J Fintech’s newly issued shares. As Korea’s third-largest credit card company, KB Kookmin Card has made inroads into the consumer loan service market in Southeast Asia since Lee Dong-chul took the top post in 2018. KB Kookmin Card took over a Tomato Specialized Bank deal in Cambodia in 2018 and signed a deal to acquire Indonesian lender Finansia Multi Finance in 2019. “The deal will serve as a cornerstone for financial units under the umbrella of KB Financial Group, including KB Kookmin Bank, to enter into Thai market” the consumer lender said in a statement.

The programs will be offered to current financial industry workers, prospective fintech entrepreneurs, fintech professionals and those who are preparing for financial sector jobs, they said.They include advanced theory and practical courses on diverse areas, such as IT deep learning, big data crawling and text analysis, cloud computing and blockchain finance, they added.The local industry has been exploring ways to use key innovations in IT, such as big data and artificial intelligence, with authorities drafting a new legal framework to make it sustainable. Observers say by opening its doors to latest technologies the financial industry would create new jobs and bring significant changes to how services are delivered, while pessimists say such technological advancement will kill jobs in the banking sector and others.With institutions gearing up efforts to speed up digital transformation in the financial sector, demand for fintech professionals has been rising. The metropolitan government forecasts the fintech industry will take a leap forward through such educational programs.“By establishing the institution in Yeouido, we hope to expand professional manpower, who can contribute to finance and fintech industries on-site. Through the process, we hope digital finance specialists can be pivotal to the industries’ growth,” said Kim Eui-seung, who heads the city’s economic policy division.The FSC and city government will select educational entities to run the project in March. Universities, research or other finance-related institutions are eligible to apply.

Taking a bold step in a heavily regulated country in terms of customer information protection and security, traditional banks and financial institutions late last year started what is called an open banking service.Offering new business opportunities to small-sized financial technology companies with the open access of customer data, the open banking system allows users to check their accounts at any local bank via a single mobile app.Viva Republica’s money transfer app Toss. (Viva Republica)With the new banking system, consumers can now compare and utilize loan and savings products of different banks more conveniently. The move came amid mounting concerns that banks and financial institutions could be disrupted by emerging fintech companies if they did not respond to rapid changes in the market. Instead of being outpaced by the new players, traditional banking institutions appear to have decided to become a disruptive force themselves. “Expectations for the fintech industry are running high with the increasing deployment of new services, including My Data and My Payment, this year,” said a source from the banking industry.My Data refers to a system that allows users to manage their personal financial information in a single software program. My Payment enables nonbanking fintech startups to offer payment services without the need to have customers’ financial assets.Tech-savvy firms like Viva Republica, a fintech unicorn and the operator of money transfer app Toss, and tech giant Naver are likely to up the ante in the competition this year.In December, Viva Republica attracted fresh investment of 64 billion won ($55 million), with its corporate value approximately reaching 2.7 trillion won. The valuation is larger than that of any other traditional financial and banking firms in Seoul, except the nation’s five largest financial groups -- KB Financial Group, Shinhan Financial Group, Hana Financial Group, Woori Financial Group and NH Financial Group.The new funding came after Viva Republica received the green light from the Financial Services Commission to launch the nation’s third internet-only bank in early December -- seven months after its first application was rejected.With the investment, the fintech unicorn will likely roll out new loan, or even stock trading, services. “The planned launch of Toss Bank will surely heat up the competition with the existing online banks, Kakao Bank and K bank,” said Lee Dong-yoon, an analyst from KB Securities, adding the short-term impact in the overall market could be limited, as there is still a year left before the bank launches.Some market analysts also warned that traditional banks will have to brace themselves for the impact of the arrival of Toss in the banking industry, as they could lose customers to their online competitor. Web portal giant Naver is preparing to flex its technology muscles in the fintech segment this year as well. Joining forces with Softbank, Naver is scheduled to establish Z Holdings this year, a holdings firm that will have mobile messenger firm Line and web portal operator Yahoo Japan under its wing. The two partners will each have 50 percent of the holdings company. While a range of new services are expected to launch through the partnership, the partners’ payment services, among others, will likely gain growth momentum based on Naver and Yahoo’s huge user bases, which reach 2.3 billion, mostly in Asia.Korean mobile payment services providers, including Kakao and NHN, are also going beyond their comfort zones in Korea, eyeing bigger opportunities in global markets. Mobile messenger firm Kakao has launched its mobile payment solution KakaoPay in Japan and Macao, allowing users to pay for their offline purchases in the local markets with the mobile app. While NHN, which runs mobile payment app Payco, is trying to infiltrate Asian markets, including Japan and Taiwan, and North American markets.“Payco boasts the largest number of offline business partners, including restaurants and stores, in Korea. Based on its presence and tech capability in the local market, the company will try to bring cross-border fintech services to other nations,” an NHN spokesperson said.Consumer transactions generated from card and electronic payments in the Asia-Pacific region are forecast to double from $18.7 trillion in 2018 to $39.4 trillion in 2024, according to global market research firm Euromonitor International’s report published in November.Some financial behemoths spare no efforts to find and nurture fintech startups as part of efforts to find new growth engines and go global. KB Financial Group and Shinhan Financial Group have recently partnered with US accelerator Plug&Play to help nurture and bring fledgling fintech firms to global markets. The startup accelerator, which runs startup support programs, has more than 10,000 startups and 300 official corporate partners. Unicorns like PayPal and Dropbox had participated in the accelerator’s programs.By Kim Young-won (wone0102@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000214620
2020.01.16.	코리아헤럴드	FSC pledges to step up efforts to grow fintech industry	With bills on personal data and credit information passing the legislature, Korean financial authority Financial Services Commission and other financial organizations on Thursday vowed to make joint efforts to create a better, fair environment for the financial technology market.“The FSC hopes to see fintech firms achieve successful results of their businesses this year, and for that, it will not spare efforts to support them,” said Kwon Dae-young, director general of FSC’s financial innovation division, at a meeting to explain the government’s deregulation measures and support policies for fintech companies in Seoul.“Beyond mobile payments, diverse segments, including insurance, health tech and asset management, will be able to grow exponentially this year (thanks to the recent revisions),” the director general added.Kwon Dae-young, director general of the Financial Services Commission’s financial innovation division, delivers a speech at a meeting with fintech companies on Thursday in Seoul. (Kim Young-won/The Korea Herald)The National Assembly passed bills to allow companies and public agencies to utilize private data and credit information for both commercial and research purposes without seeking consent. Under the eased regulations, a company, for example, can collect user information held by different firms and institutes to develop new services and marketing schemes tailored for individual users. In addition, social media accounts, such as Instagram or Facebook, can be used in assessing a person’s credit rate.The FSC forecast that the bills will help accelerate investments and generate mergers and acquisitions among fintech firms, as the overall fintech market is likely to become much bigger in the coming years.Aiming to further galvanize the industry, the FSC is working to clear out remaining regulatory hurdles. The revisions of the existing Financial Innovation and Electronic Financial Transactions acts are expected to be passed at the National Assembly after the scheduled general elections in April. When passed, they will allow the emergence of new fintech business models, according to an official from the FSC division. As announced earlier this week, the FSC has also increased its budget to bolster the fintech industry, from 10 billion won ($8.6 million) in 2019 to 198 billion won this year. Some of the money will be spent to operate fintech laboratories and accelerator programs, through which startups can receive consulting services to tap into global markets and use office space.Other ongoing projects at the FSC include those aimed at embracing biometric payment technologies in the fintech market, establishing fintech security guidelines and opening up financial data to third parties. Officials from financial authorities and organizations including Financial Services Commission and Korea Exchange participate in a meeting with fintech companies on Thursday in Seoul. (Kim Young-won/The Korea Herald)“The FSC and its affiliated agencies hold 330 billion pieces of financial data, which have largely been inaccessible so far,” said Kim Jae-dong, an official at FSC’s public data division, adding it will soon complete the first phase of the project to organize public data and open some 200 data sets, or 5,000 points of data, to the public in May.Together with Fintech Center Korea, an organization affiliated with the FSC to support fintech startups, the FSC plans to hold a trade fair in May and meetings between private companies and state agencies this year.Participating in the Thursday meeting, an official from Korea Exchange, the nation’s stock market operator, said the bourse operator will keep pursuing efforts to come up with fintech-friendly rules so that more startups can secure funds through initial public offerings. K-Growth, an operator of funds jointly launched by the nation’s financial institutes, including KB Financial Group, and Woori Financial Group also promised to help startups from the early to pre-IPO stages scale up.By Kim Young-won (wone0102@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000214915
2020.02.06.	코리아헤럴드	Kakao’s entry into brokerage to vitalize fintech market: reports	Mobile messenger Kakao’s entry into the stock trading market, via its fintech spinoff Kakao Pay, will boost growth of the financial technology sector and the brokerage market, according to local analysts on Thursday.The Financial Services Commissions, South Korea’s financial regulator, on Wednesday approved Kakao Pay’s request to acquire a controlling 60 percent stake in local brokerage Baro Investment & Securities. The stock trader has been renamed to Kakao Pay Securities. “Kakao currently runs -- via its spinoffs and affiliates like Kakao Pay and Kakao Bank -- payment, transfer and banking services, and the latest acquisition of Baro will help vitalize the fintech market,” said Lee Dong-yoon, an analyst from KB Securities, recommending “buy” on the Kakao stock.As of 2019, Kakao Pay had attracted 30 million subscribers, while the number of monthly active users had exceeded 20 million. Total transactions reached 12.9 trillion won ($10.9 billion) in the third quarter last year.Seong Jong-hwa, an analyst of eBest Investment & Securities, highly evaluated Kakao Pay’s potential in the stock market as well as the fintech area.“Kakao Pay has completed technical preparations to build systems, which will be linked to Baro’s current cash management accounts, for trading domestic and global stocks, bonds, and funds,” said the eBest analyst in a report.Officially launching its online stock trading business on Thursday, Kakao Pay said it would start receiving preliminary applications from its subscribers to upgrade their Kakao platforms with the firm’s new stock trading services.“Working closely with Kakao Pay for the stock brokerage service for individuals, Kakao Pay Securities will also make efforts to nurture its financing services for businesses,” Kim Dae-hong, CEO of the stock company, said.

2020.01.13.	코리아헤럴드	Visa Korea to launch new services amid changing fintech landscape	Visa Korea on Monday announced plans to launch new services this year, in an effort to grow its presence in the emerging segments of big data and contactless payment solutions.To help its corporate clients strengthen their marketing strategies, Visa Korea said it would provide marketing solutions based on big data analytics technology for a more diverse range of businesses.Visa Korea CEO Patrick Yoon speaks at a media event in Seoul on Monday. (Visa Korea)The global payment giant currently has a team of 500 data analysts and consultants who offer insights into data-based marketing for companies in 11 Asia-Pacific nations, including South Korea. From this year, the Korean branch will provide data analytics and consulting services for companies in diverse industries, including domestic card issuers, fintech startups, internet-only banks and online merchants.In addition, the Seoul office will launch Visa Direct, a global money transfer service, and Visa Token Service, a payment solution that allows users to make online and offline purchases in overseas markets.It will also operate a center at its new head office in Seoul, where it runs collaborative projects with local fintech companies.New legislation in Korea easing regulations on the use of personal information will enable Visa to achieve cross-industry innovation as well as accelerate the growth of the fintech and payment industries, according to Visa Korea CEO Patrick Yoon. “Visa, which has a competitive edge in data analytics, will spearhead the payment industry while working closely with its partners to offer convenient services,” said Yoon at a press conference in Seoul.He also hinted at continuing Visa Korea’s search for new businesses through mergers and acquisitions of startups, as well as partnerships with internet-only banks and fintech companies in Korea.Among the global fintech companies acquired by the payment firm last year were money transfer solution startup Earthport, payment protection solutions firm Verifi and point-of-sale payment gateway provider Payworks.By Kim Young-won (wone0102@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000214796
2020.01.15.	코리아헤럴드	Eased data protection rules to benefit fintech giants and startups: analysts	The recent passage of bills on personal data and credit information of individuals by the National Assembly will likely give a boost to fintech giants and startups in South Korea, according to analysts.The three revised bills regarding the protection of private information, information and communications networks, and the use and protection of credit information will allow companies as well as government agencies to utilize personal information for various research and business purposes without seeking consent from individuals. Although the data will be more accessible under the new rules, the identity of users will be concealed.Logos of Kakao Pay, N Pay, and Payco, three of Korea’s most used fintech applicationsBecause of the existing rules, which have long been considered rigid and outdated, companies have been blocked from utilizing the data of their customers to develop new services, while their global peers are exploring new projects with such data.Among companies listed on Korea’s main bourse Kospi, financial technology giants Naver, Kakao and NHN, all of which run payment and e-commerce businesses are expected to be among the biggest beneficiaries of the revisions, analysts said.“Fintech services, like Kakao Bank (as well as Kakao Pay), Payco, and Naver Pay, are getting ready to launch, or have already launched, loans with midrange interest rates after building their own credit rating systems that utilize users’ financial and credit data,” said Seong Jong-hwa, an analyst from eBest Investment & Securities, in a recent report.He added NHN, the operator of Payco, and Kakao, the largest shareholder of Kakao Bank, in particular, will likely play a crucial role in leading the state-led “My Data,” project, which opens up -- with consent -- customers’ financial data held by private companies and public organizations to third parties.NHN ran a pilot for the My Data project, while Kakao is expected to apply to participate in the government-led project in the coming months.“Along with six financial firms, NHN launched the first My Data service, named ‘My Data Service,’ in November last year,” said a company representative. “The revised bills will help the firm to take its financial services and platforms to the next level.”On expectations of the eased regulations since late last year, the stock prices of Kakao, Naver, and NHN have been on the upswing. Tech giant NHN’s mobile financial service Payco (Payco)Kakao saw its shares hit a 52-week high of 170,500 won ($147) Wednesday and Naver’s stock price reached a 52-week high of 194,500 won Tuesday. NHN’s stock rose 29.7 percent, based on end-of-day prices, to 77,300 won from Nov. 1 to Jan. 14.National Information & Credit Evaluation, or NICE Group, a credit rating agency that holds a vast amount of information of the public, will benefit from the easing of data protection regulations too, according to market analysts.“The revised bills will enable credit rating firms to operate for-profit businesses with their data,” said Kim Soo-hyeon, an analyst from Shinhan Investment, painting a rosy picture for the agency.Under the new rules, credit rating agencies can factor in nonfinancial data to assess credit ratings, including the payment of bills and even personal information from e-commerce websites and social media platforms like Instagram.Bourgeoning fintech startups have welcomed the revisions, saying the eased regulations will blow the door wide open for new opportunities. “This year will be a focal point for Rainist to better serve users with convenient services and offer them benefits,” said Kim Tae-hoon, CEO of Rainist, a fintech firm that operates asset management solution Banksalad, in a statement released after the passage of the bills last week. The revised bills are expected to go into effect in July.By Kim Young-won (wone0102@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000214879

The company plans to have Arques start its service in the overseas market first, including the United States, next year. Currently, it is reviewing related regulations. The plan for domestic introduction is not decided yet. NXC has been actively exploring fintech market. The company bought 92 percent stake in NIS Indra Fund, a fintech-specialized private equity fund with primary focus in India, earlier this month. It also previously acquired European cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=009&aid=0004547732
2020.04.22.	연합뉴스	[PRNewswire] "Startup the Bank" Report by PKO Bank Polski Available Now	-- Startups transforming one of the biggest banking sectors in CEE(WARSAW, Poland, April 21, 2020 PRNewswire=연합뉴스) "Startup the Bank" is the most recent report on startups whose solutions transform the Polish banking sector. According to the study, not only traditional fintech companies stand the chance of becoming banks' technological partners and after a successful pilot project, 7 out of 10 companies continue to cooperate. The report, prepared jointly by the largest bank in the region, along with partners, offers a study of 100 companies from the fintech industry.In the digital transformation era, adaptation of innovative technologies is the only way to win the market. Expenditures on development of innovations in the Polish banking sector have been growing by 14.5% on average annually; in 2019 they amounted to PLN 1.6 billion. A significant portion of solutions are worked out by the banks together with their technological partners. Who are the authors of the state-of-the-art tools for the banking sector? What is the course of development of innovative companies? Who are their customers and how long does it take to source them? The answers to these and many other questions are presented in the "Startup the Bank" report, prepared jointly by PKO Bank Polski, PKO VC, the Domestic Cloud Provider and The Heart.How to "break into" a bank Banks in the region specialise in a systemic approach to the cooperation with startups more than any other industry, building dedicated programs and innovation teams. Acceleration in banking offers a 3-times higher guarantee of signing a contract than in other sectors (where traditional sale performs better). The most efficient mode of launching cooperation is a pilot project. Almost 9 out of 10 startups cooperating with banks had "pilots" of their solutions. For 70% of them, this allowed the signing of a commercial contract. According to 40% of respondents, their solutions are a must-have for a modern banking sector. Three major implementation areas include data analysis, internal process optimisation and customer servicing.Financial benefits are the most important aspect of cooperation only for 17% of companies. A definite majority is more interested in image-related benefits or access to the customer base, along with feedback from the professional partner. Results show that apart from Poland, the market for researched startups include the UK, Germany, the US, Spain and Singapore.

After Nexon founder’s attempt to sell he and his wife’s 98.6 percent stake in NXC fell through last year, he has been reshuffling the business by offloading non-core assets.

2020.02.07.	매경닷컴	Korea to ease regulations in stem cell research, fintech to spur growth	South Korea has set out to ease stiff regulations in healthcare, fintech and other key sectors by the first half of the year, in efforts to jumpstart a weak economy that is likely to slow further from the coronavirus outbreak.The Ministry of Economy and Finance on Thursday announced 10 sectors for deregulation, which include data and artificial intelligence (AI), future mobility, new medical technology, healthcare, fintech, technology entrepreneurialism, industrial parks, resource circulation, tourism, and ecommerce and logistics. A taskforce dedicated to each sector and headed by the deputy finance minister would be launched next week. The team would be tasked with coming up with a detailed list of deregulations by March. They would go through each one, review their importance and chuck out those deemed unnecessary, a process that will last through June. One area of considerable attention is embryonic stem cell research, a promising new field in medicine that came to an abrupt halt in Korea more than a decade ago following a massive scandal involving the cloning expert Hwang Woo-suk. Hwang, once hailed as a national hero in the country, made international headlines in 2004 when he claimed to have created the world’s first human embryos and extracted stem cells from them. He went on to publish another paper claiming his team had cloned stem cells that genetically matched those of specific patients, raising hopes of a breakthrough in the treatment of diseases like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s. But those papers turned out to be fabricated and he was later convicted on charges of fraud, embezzling state research funds and violating bioethics laws.   Hwang’s epic downfall put a sudden stop to Korea’s stem cell research, with local researchers forced to take their studies abroad in the face of stringent new regulations. A finance ministry official admitted that calls for deregulation had been exceptionally strong in this field, especially for some restrictions that were unique to Korea, such as allowing the use of only frozen eggs in research. Another highly regulated sector has been fintech. Local laws currently limit the equity investment of non-financial businesses in financial entities and vice versa, a longstanding practice initially adopted to separate banking and commerce to prevent large companies from using banks like their personal safe. But this rule has been blamed for thwarting the growth of new fintech services, which rely on a more interconnected network of different stakeholders. The government also plans to set up a conflict resolution committee to play a mediating role in potential clashes between new and incumbent businesses. For particularly contentious issues with major social repercussions, like the rental van-hailing service Tada that is on the brink of being outlawed due to vehement taxi opposition, the state is considering receiving recommendations from a special committee chaired by the prime minister. Ride-hailing service has failed to take off in Korea due to a patchwork of regulations created to protect the local taxi industry. Tada’s fledgling business hit a major snag late last year after its executives were indicted and lawmakers sought to revise the vehicle laws to significantly limit Tada’s business scope.   The Korean government has turned aggressive in deregulating promising new industries amid growing concerns that economic recovery would be delayed due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus. The export-reliant economy’s major industries, such as auto manufacturing and semiconductors, are poised to suspend their production lines due to the supply chain disruption caused by the epidemic originated in China, a global manufacturing hub. Asia’s fourth-largest economy has been hoping to jumpstart its economy by fostering the growth of novel sectors after its economy remained stagnant throughout last year due to a sharp fall in exports from prolonged trade disputes between its two biggest trade partners the U.S. and China.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=009&aid=0004513609

2020.02.05.	코리아헤럴드	Kakao Pay gets green light to acquire local brokerage	Kakao Pay CEO Ryu Young-joon speaks at a conference in November 2018. (Kakao Pay)The Financial Services Commission, South Korea’s financial regulator, said Wednesday that it has approved fintech firm Kakao Pay’s request to become the largest shareholder of brokerage house Baro Investment & Securities.With that final authorization, the fintech firm will be able to operate stock trading businesses on its own mobile platforms as well as those run by its parent firm, mobile messenger giant Kakao.Last year the Kakao fintech spinoff submitted an application for preliminary approval to acquire 60 percent of the local brokerage firm, and the financial regulator granted temporary approval earlier this year. Kakao’s stake in Baro is estimated to be worth 40 billion won ($33.6 million)“The regulator has reviewed three categories, including financial stability and debt status, and Kakao Pay passed the standards,” said the FSC in a press release. Since it announced the acquisition plans in October 2018, the mobile payment company vowed to expand its business leverage to various investments and asset management by enabling stock trading within the mobile messenger service KakaoTalk.The FSC screening process was halted for several months, however, as Kakao Chairman Kim Beom-su faced accusations of omitting a required statement on the status of the company’s affiliates. The process resumed in November last year after the high court cleared him of wrongdoing.Under the Capital Market and Financial Investment Business Act, major shareholders of financial companies are required to have no record of any criminal penalty within the past five years for breaching financial laws.Kakao Pay saw its quarterly transaction volume on its fintech platforms climb from 10.6 trillion won in January-March to 11.4 trillion won in April-June and 12.9 trillion in July-September last year. The company’s estimated transaction volume for this year is around 68 trillion won, according to eBest Investment & Securities, and should rise further upon the confirmed acquisition of Baro Investment.By Kim Young-won (wone0102@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000215350

2020.02.27.	연합뉴스	[PRNewswire] PLMP Fintech's Venture Capital entity secures Fund Management	licence to bring blockchain to over 10,000 SMEs in 10 years(PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, Feb. 26, 2020 PRNewswire=연합뉴스) The local investment arm of Singaporean blockchain firm PLMP Fintech, PLMP Venture Capital, has been awarded today an Asset and Fund Management licence by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Cambodia (SECC). The move is part of the company's ten-year target to incubate more than 10,000 SMEs through blockchain solutions and networking opportunities."We have a diversified portfolio of technological, real estate and financial projects that are already in the works," says PLMP Fintech Co-Founder Peter Lim citing the examples of the Creatanium Smart City and the ongoing integration of Indonesia's logistics sector with the firm's own blockchain protocol.In the words of Kym Kee, Managing Director of PLMP Venture Capital, "The licence will open the doors to institutional and high-net-worth investment as we plan for the Creatanium Silicon Valley."

2020.02.05.	코리아헤럴드	Kakao Pay gets green light to acquire local brokerage	Kakao Pay CEO Ryu Young-joon speaks at a conference in November 2018. (Kakao Pay)The Financial Services Commission, South Korea’s financial regulator, said Wednesday that it has approved fintech firm Kakao Pay’s request to become the largest shareholder of brokerage house Baro Investment & Securities.With that final authorization, the fintech firm will be able to operate stock trading businesses on its own mobile platforms as well as those run by its parent firm, mobile messenger giant Kakao.Last year the Kakao fintech spinoff submitted an application for preliminary approval to acquire 60 percent of the local brokerage firm, and the financial regulator granted temporary approval earlier this year. Kakao’s stake in Baro is estimated to be worth 40 billion won ($33.6 million)“The regulator has reviewed three categories, including financial stability and debt status, and Kakao Pay passed the standards,” said the FSC in a press release. Since it announced the acquisition plans in October 2018, the mobile payment company vowed to expand its business leverage to various investments and asset management by enabling stock trading within the mobile messenger service KakaoTalk.The FSC screening process was halted for several months, however, as Kakao Chairman Kim Beom-su faced accusations of omitting a required statement on the status of the company’s affiliates. The process resumed in November last year after the high court cleared him of wrongdoing.Under the Capital Market and Financial Investment Business Act, major shareholders of financial companies are required to have no record of any criminal penalty within the past five years for breaching financial laws.Kakao Pay saw its quarterly transaction volume on its fintech platforms climb from 10.6 trillion won in January-March to 11.4 trillion won in April-June and 12.9 trillion in July-September last year. The company’s estimated transaction volume for this year is around 68 trillion won, according to eBest Investment & Securities, and should rise further upon the confirmed acquisition of Baro Investment.By Kim Young-won (wone0102@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000215350
2020.04.22.	매경닷컴	Shinsegae adds open banking service on mobile payment platform SSGPay	South Korean retail giant Shinsegae Group added banking service to its mobile payment service SSGPay, enabling consumers to run tasks in different banks on the platform. It is the first service among the local retailers but somewhat disappointing, compared to other services offered by fintech firms, some say. Shinsegae Group announced Tuesday it started the singularized banking service on its simple payment platform SSGPay to allow customers to manage multiple bank accounts and withdraw and transfer money from the single app. Open banking is a system in which banks allow third parties such as fintech startups, or other firms like SSGPay, to have access to bank accounts and payment network. With the new system, SSGPay users now are able to enjoy more convenient in-app financial services with fingerprint recognition, simply passwords or PINs. Retail companies recently are active in developing own mobile payment options and adding more fintech services to widen the use of new platforms amid surge in e-commerce. According to data released by Bank of Korea, transactions made via mobile payment solutions jumped 56.5 percent to total 6.02 million as of the end of last year, valued at 174.5 billion won ($141.4 million) after adding 44 percent from a year ago. Markets however remain skeptical about the usage of payment services by e-commerce platform operators as their solutions are available only at their shopping malls under family, unlike Naver Pay and Kakao Pay. SSGPay’s new service also does not allow users to transfer their cash on their SSGPay account to others as the deposits can be made with credit cards using money that the users do not actually own. Kakao Pay however accepts prepaid cash deposits only to allow the wiring service with the money, bringing more convenience to users enjoying simple money transfer with phone numbers, not entering the entire account number. Wiring on other Shinsegae family apps like E-mart and SSG.com also is not available. Shinsegae Group to expand the service usage and better appeal to customers now is planning to discuss ways with the financial authority. “Wiring service using phone numbers and based on deposits will be added after review with the authority,” said a company official. Meanwhile, the country’s top e-commerce operator Coupang Corp. recently has spun off payment service CouPay to wholly-owned separate entity Coupang Pay to enhance fintech business. CouPay with its convenient payment service grew fast to secure comparable dominance to Samsung Pay and Smile Pay with a membership of 10 million as of June last year. Lotte Shopping also is preparing the launch of integrated shopping platform Lotte ON for seven retail units, which will be loaded with own mobile payment system L.pay at the end of the month.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=009&aid=0004561765

2020.06.23.	한경비즈니스	IT 업고 부상한 신흥 금융 강자들	[커버스토리=금융 판을 흔드는 진격의 테크핀]- 카카오와 네이버의 금융 플랫폼 경쟁…토스·웹캐시·에임·뱅크샐러드 등 ‘테크핀’ 기업 가세 [한경비즈니스=이현주 기자] 금융과 정보기술(IT)이 결합된 핀테크(fintech)가 금융 혁신을 주도하고 있다. 더 빠르고 더 편리한 금융 서비스를 원하는 소비자들의 트렌드에 민첩하게 대응하면서 전통적인 금융업의 판도를 흔들고 있다. 최근 신종 코로나바이러스 감염증(코로나19)으로 디지털 전환이 가속화되는 가운데 핀테크의 영향력이 더욱 커지고 있는 상황이다. 국내 핀테크 산업은 2014년 말부터 금융권의 관심을 받기 시작했다. 소규모 IT 기업이 금융사의 서비스를 개별화해 사용이 편리하고 가격이 저렴한 다양한 금융 서비스를 내놓기 시작했다. 특히 공인 인증서와 일회용 비밀번호(OTP)를 사용하지 않고 상대방 은행의 계좌 번호가 아닌 전화번호만 이용해 송금할 수 있는 간편 송금 서비스가 출현했다. 국내 핀테크 산업은 정부의 핀테크 활성화 정책 추진과 규제 완화 등에 힘입어 매년 기업 수가 폭발적으로 증가하고 있다. 한국핀테크산업협회에 따르면 창립 당시인 2016년 4월 109개 회원사에서 2019년 10월 기준 총 328개 회원사로 3년 동안 3배 이상 꾸준히 증가했다. 송금·결제·대출·자산 관리 등 다양한 금융 서비스 분야로 영역을 확대하면서 영향력을 키워 가는 중이다. 핀테크를 넘어 IT를 중심으로 새로운 금융 서비스를 창출하는 ‘테크핀(techfin)’으로 금융업에 빠르게 침투하고 있다. 포스트 코로나 시대의 디지털 금융 네이버는 최근 미래에셋대우와 환매조건부채권(RP)형 종합자산관리계좌(CMA) ‘네이버통장’을 출시했다. 원금이 보장되지 않는 CMA이지만 통장이라는 이름으로 은행의 고유 영역을 공략하기 시작했다. 예치금 보관에 따른 3% 수익뿐만 아니라 통장과 연계된 네이버페이로 충전·결제하면 3%의 포인트 적립 혜택도 함께 제공한다. 네이버플러스 멤버십 회원이라면 혜택을 최대 9%포인트 받을 수 있도록 설정돼 있다. 네이버는 2015년 6월 간편 결제 서비스 ‘네이버페이’를 출시하면서 전자 금융업에 본격적으로 뛰어든 이후 특히 작년부터 눈에 띄게 금융업 진출이 늘고 있다. 네이버파이낸셜을 통해 전자 금융업으로 금융 서비스를 대폭 확대하면서 은행 고유의 수신 업무를 제외하고 사실상 모든 금융 업무를 수행할 수 있다. 이르면 7월에 후불 소액 결제 서비스까지 가능해져 신용카드업으로 업무 영역을 넓힐 것으로 보인다. 시중은행의 예·적금 금리보다 좋은 조건을 내세운 네이버통장이 눈길을 끌자 은행들도 위기감을 내비치고 있다. 은행과 카드사가 연계해 최대 8%대 고금리 상품을 출시하는 등 즉각 반격에 나서고 있다. 금융권이 네이버통장에 긴장하는 이유는 앞서 카카오뱅크가 쏘아올린 모바일 뱅킹 경쟁을 겪은 바 있기 때문이다. 카카오뱅크는 2017년 국내 제2호 인터넷 전문은행으로 출범한 이후 빠르게 성장해 올해 1분기 기준 총자산이 23조4000원에 달한다. 카카오는 지난 2월 카카오페이를 통해 바로투자증권을 인수하고 카카오페이증권으로 사명을 바꿨다. 이용자가 카카오톡으로 자동차 보험에 가입하는 서비스를 준비하고 있다. 또 3월에는 5%대 수익률을 보장하는 증권 계좌를 출시했다. 향후 자산 관리·투자·보험 서비스를 제공하는 종합 금융 플랫폼으로 빠르게 진화할 것으로 예상된다. 네어버와 카카오는 코로나19 이후 주식 시장에서 고공 행진하고 있다. 네이버는 시가총액 4위, 카카오는 10위에 올랐다. 여기에는 금융 부문에 대한 기대감도 한몫하고 있다. 네이버와 카카오는 비대면 트렌드가 본격화되는 시점에서 금융 분야로의 외연 확장에 나서고 있다. 전통적인 금융업에서 내놓지 못한 혁신 서비스를 출시하고 기존 결제 서비스와 연계하면서 파급력을 키우고 있다. 이들은 대형 인터넷 기업의 금융 진출을 의미하는 빅테크로 불리면서 신흥 금융 강자로 부상하고 있다. 김민정 하이투자증권 애널리스트는 “금융 시장은 기존 은행·증권·보험 등 금융업권 내 경쟁에서 이제는 금융 산업과 빅테크 기업 간 경쟁으로 이동하고 있고 언택트 문화로 기존 금융 회사의 경쟁력이 약화되고 있는 추세”라며 “네이버와 카카오는 최근 통장 등 금융 상품 혜택 확대에 주력하며 금융 기능을 자체 플랫폼 내에 구축하는 행보를 가속화하고 있다”고 말했다. 여기에 다양한 분야에서 테크핀 기업들이 신흥 금융 강자로 가세한다. 간편 결제 1위인 토스, 자산 관리 1위인 에임, B2B 테크핀 1호 상장사 웹캐시, 코스닥시장에 상장한 세틀뱅크, 모바일 자산 관리 플랫폼 뱅크샐러드 등이다. 각 분야별로 금융 시장의 틈새에서 특화 서비스를 선보이고 있다. 미국·중국에서도 테크핀 열풍 디지털 플랫폼 형태의 테크핀 기업들이 가지는 특장점은 금융 소비자의 새로운 니즈를 충족시키기에 적합한 구조라는 것이다. 조용선 SK증권 애널리스트는 “초기 단계인 송금·결제 영역에서는 ‘편의성’과 ‘신뢰성’, ‘수용성’과 ‘확장성’을 기반으로 카카오페이·네이버페이 등이 이미 주도적으로 섭렵하고 있고 향후 각자의 영역에 부합되는 종합 금융 서비스와 데이터 사업자로서의 확장성이 기대된다”고 말했다. 맥킨지는 2025년께 기존 금융회사들은 수익의 40%를 테크핀 기업에 빼앗길 가능성이 있다고 발표했다. 김민아 애널리스트트는 “국내 금융 업종 시가총액은 연초 대비 19% 감소했고 빅테크 기업의 금융 시장점유율이 확대될수록 금융 업종의 시가총액 감소분은 빅테크 업종으로 이동할 것으로 예상된다”고 말했다. 최근 국내 테크핀 기업들에 기대감이 커진 배경에는 해외에서의 성공 사례가 있다. 2020년 미국 빅테크 기업들의 금융업 진출과 파트너십 강화가 더욱 강화될 것으로 보인다. 애플은 지난해 8월 신용카드인 애플카드를 출시했고 구글은 올해 지급 결제용 은행 당좌 계좌 서비스를 출시할 예정이다. 중국의 알리페이는 앤트파이낸셜로 사명을 바꾼 뒤 금융 서비스에 본격 진출해 인터넷 은행과 대출 서비스로 빠르게 성장하고 있고 증권·보험 등으로 확장해 전 세계에서 가장 높은 기업 가치를 인정받는 테크핀 기업이 됐다. 네이버파이낸셜과 카카오페이도 앤트파이낸셜 모델을 따라가는 모양새다. 앤트파이낸셜은 알리바바 그룹 안에 입점한 중소상인들에게 대출 서비스를 하면서 입지를 다질 수 있었고 증권·보험 등으로 확장하고 있다. 네이버는 네이버쇼핑 내 입점한 중소상인 대상의 대출 서비스를 지향하고 있다. 카카오페이는 증권업에 진출한 뒤 기존의 카카오페이 계좌를 증권 계좌와 연동하면서 다양한 서비스를 가시화할 것으로 보인다. 이와 같은 빅테크 기업의 금융 진격에 따라 전통적인 금융권에서도 트렌드 변화가 예상된다. 온라인 대출 플랫폼 확장에 집중하고 온라인 대출 관련 테크핀 기업들과의 파트너십 결성이 늘어날 것으로 보인다. 이미 국내 주요 은행들은 지주사를 중심으로 핀테크 랩을 만들어 기술 기반의 테크핀 업체들을 입주시키고 시드 머니를 제공하며 협업을 늘려 가고 있다. 특히 금융회사는 오픈 뱅킹을 본격 적용한 후 테크핀 기업과의 협력 확대가 불가피하다. 향후 ‘마이데이터’ 시장이 열리면 또 하나의 경쟁의 판이 열린다. 은행·카드·보험·통신사 등에 흩어져 있는 금융 거래 정보 등을 일괄 수집해 금융 소비자에게 제공하고 이를 토대로 맞춤형 상품 추천, 금융 상품 자문 등 수익을 창출할 수 있다. 올 초 ‘데이터3법’ 가운데 하나인 신용정보법 개정안이 국회 문턱을 넘으면서 마이데이터 시장의 각축전이 예상된다. 금융위원회에 따르면 사업 허가 희망 의사를 밝힌 곳은 금융회사 55개와 테크핀 기업 20개, 비금융 회사 41개 등이다. 네이버와 카카오를 비롯해 토스를 운영하는 비바리퍼블리카 등 테크핀 업체들도 사업 진출 의사를 밝힌 것으로 알려졌다.신흥 금융 강자로 떠오른 테크핀 업체들은 금융 시장에서 ‘메기’ 역할을 십분 발휘하고 있는 것으로 보인다. 최근 언택트 환경에서 오프라인 은행들은 점포를 줄이고 테크핀 기업의 기술을 받아들여 모방·진화하고 있다. 소비자들로서는 다양한 상품과 혜택 등 금융 편의성을 누리는 셈이다. 특히 기존 1금융권의 사각지대였던 취약 계층에 대한 금융 서비스를 기술 기반의 새로운 신용 평가 모델에 근거해 다양하게 제공할 수 있는 부분은 신흥 금융 강자들이 긍정적인 변화를 이끄는 부분이다. 한편 빅테크 기업의 시장 집중도가 지나치게 높아질 경우 우려도 제기된다. 금융 플랫폼으로서 유통의 힘이 커지면 제조업에 필요한 시설 투자 자금을 공급하는 금융 본연의 기능이 약화될 수 있다. 한 금융업계 관계자는 “플랫폼에서 단순 유통하면 신용 리스크를 지지 않기 때문에 자유롭게 다양한 상품을 혁신적으로 만들 수 있는 반면 불확실성이 커질 수 있는 부분이 있다”며 “제조업이나 중소기업을 발굴해 대출해 주기보다 다양한 펀드 상품 판매에 치중하는 등 수수료 수익을 남길 수 있는 부분으로 집중할 수 있다”고 말했다.charis@hankyung.com[금융 판을 흔드는 진격의 테크핀 기사 인덱스]-IT 업고 부상한 신흥 금융 강자들-카카오페이, 결제와 투자 연결해 ‘생활 금융 플랫폼’으로-네이버파이낸셜, 지난해 11월 네이버에서 분사…페이·통장으로 ‘금융사’ 역할 수행-토스, 치과의사가 만든 ‘간편송금’ 1000만 사용하는 ‘국민 금융 앱’ 됐다-에임, ‘300만원 소액 투자도 OK’…문턱 낮춰 자산 관리 대중화 이끈다-웹케시, 핀테크 상장 1호…B2B 금융에서 경쟁력 갖춰-뱅크샐러드, 고객 연동 관리 자산 220조원…‘데이터 라이프’ 선점한다[본 기사는 한경비즈니스 제 1282호(2020.06.20 ~ 2020.06.26) 기사입니다.]▶ 한경비즈니스 네이버 뉴스에서 [구독 클릭]▶ '한경비즈니스' 바로가기 ▶ 잡지 정기구독 신청  당사의 허락 없이 본 글과 사진의 무단 전재 및 재배포를 금합니다.	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=050&aid=0000054018
2020.06.11.	디지털데일리	센스톤, 코로나19로 글로벌시장 꽉막혔지만 해외사업 '발군의 성과'	[디지털데일리 이상일기자] 센스톤(대표이사 유창훈)은 런던 베이스의 글로벌 비즈니스 헤드쿼터 'swIDch(스위치)'를 통해 최근 글로벌 시장에서 여러가지 성과를 달성했다고 11일 밝혔다.먼저 한국 스타트업 최초로 'The EUROPAS 2020'과 ‘CyberTech 100’에 선정, 유엔(UN)이 설립한 익스트림테크챌린지(Extreme Tech Challenge, XTC)에 영국 스타트업 자격으로 최종 파이널리스트에 선정 되었다.'The EUROPAS 2020'은 2009년부터 지난 10년간 진행된 유럽 테크 스타트업 어워드 행사로 지금까지 스포티파이(Spotify), 트랜스퍼와이즈(Transferwise) 등 많은 유럽 테크 스타트업을 발굴하고 네트워킹을 통해 글로벌 기술 이슈를 다루는 스타트업 생태계 조성에 앞장서는 규모있는 행사다.센스톤은 이번 대회의 미래 기술로 채택된 핀테크(FinTech), 인공지능(AI), 블록체인(Blockchain) 등 20개 카테고리 중 사이버 기술(CyberTech) 스타트업 분야에서 세계 최초 단방향 다이나믹 코드 인증 기술, 'OTAC(One-Time Authentication Code)'을 통해 최종 명단에 올랐다. 따라서 센스톤은 산업계 전문가와 투자자에게 센스톤의 새로운 인증 기술을 소개하고 글로벌 VC와의 투자 협상 기회까지 얻게 됐다.또한, 센스톤은 글로벌 핀테크 연구 및 분석 전문 기업, '핀테크 글로벌(Fintech Global)'에서 매년 산업별 기술 전문가와 애널리스트 패널이 선정하는 '전 세계에서 가장 혁신적인 CyberTech 100'에 선정되며 아마존(Amazon), 페이팔(Paypal), 록히드마틴(Lockheed Martin), 마이크로소프트(MS), 영국NHS 등 글로벌 기업에 기술 공급 및 투자 유치한 업체들과 이름을 나란히 올렸다.센스톤의 글로벌 행보는 여기서 끝이 아니다. 유엔(UN)이 세계적인 빈곤, 기아, 기후변화 등 17가지 지속가능개발목표(SDG)를 달성하기 위해 설립된 세계 최대 스타트업 경진대회 '익스트림테크챌린지(Extreme Tech Challenge, XTC)'에서도 최종 기업으로 선정됐다. 올해 XTC에는 전 세계에서 2400개의 스타트업이 지원하여 52개의 기업이 선택됐다. 익스트림테크챌린지(XTC)는 프로그램 기간 중 최대 120억 원 규모의 투자유치와 글로벌 기업들과의 콜라보 기회가 부여될 계획이며 이는 관련 분야 스타트업 투자액으로는 최대 수준이다. 삼성전자(SAMSUNG), 시스코(CISCO), 암(ARM), 줌(ZOOM) 등 글로벌 정보기술(IT) 선두 기업이 XTC 파트너로 있다.swIDch(스위치)의 운영을 총괄하는 오수현 COO는 “XTC의 경우 영국 스타트업으로 2개 기업이 선정되었는데 그 중 한국계 스타트업인 swIDch가 선정되었다”며, “이는 영국에 진출한 글로벌 스타트업 중에 기술 우수성과 성장 가능성, 납품 실적 등 센스톤이 그동안 글로벌 시장에서 얻은 성과로 평가 받은 것이라 더 기쁘고, swIDch가 글로벌 헤드쿼터로서의 위치를 확고히 다졌다"라고 말했다.센스톤의 OTAC 기술은 클라이언트 디바이스에서 자체 생성(Generation)된 다이나믹 코드를 통해 사용자를 식별하는 인증 기술이다. 서버나 네트워크 연결없이 해커의 진입이 완전 차단된 상태에서 클라이언트 인증이 이루어지는 단방향 인증 방식을 적용해 현재 가장 안전한 인증 방식으로 평가받고 있다. OTAC 기술은 IoT, 클라우드 등 온라인에 연결되는 기기가 많아질수록 발생하는 인증 트래픽 부하를 획기적으로 줄인다. 또한 클라이언트는 통신 환경에 영향받지 않아 네트워크가 단절되거나 통신 환경이 불안정한 곳에서도 안전한 인증 환경을 제공한다. 센스톤은 XTC에 최종 선정됨에 따라 UN의 대회 설립 취지에 맞게 인도주의적 차원에서 OTAC 기술을 전 세계 코로나19로 인한 비식별 개인정보를 활용하는 출입관리 솔루션에 전 세계 어느 국가든 요청하면 기부한다.센스톤 유창훈 대표는 "센스톤은 현재 코로나19로 인해 글로벌 사업 기회가 경색된 상황에서도 글로벌 시장에서 멈추지 않는 행보를 한국 스타트업 최초로 계속 이어가고 있다"면서, "올해 아시아권의 실적을 넘어 유럽과 기타 지역으로 가시적인 성과가 확대될 것으로 내다보고 있다”고 말했다. <이상일 기자>2401@ddaily.co.kr▶ 네이버에서 디지털데일리 채널 구독하기▶ IT정보의 즐거운 업그레이드 [딜라이트닷넷]<저작권자 © 디지털데일리 무단전재-재배포금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=105&oid=138&aid=0002087161
2020.05.26.	코리아헤럴드	[Andy Mukherjee] China’s crypto is all about tracing -- and power	The coronavirus has disrupted the world in very large ways. While that battle has been waged, however, another event has almost been missed: the birth of a new kind of fiat currency, which could forever reshape the relationship between money, economic power and geopolitical clout.　An official Chinese digital yuan, more than five years in the making, is now in pilot runs to slowly start replacing the physical legal tender. If the experiment succeeds, this new cash, valued the same as the familiar banknotes bearing Mao Zedong’s image, will become the world’s first sovereign token to reside exclusively in the ether.　The trials are taking place just as the blame game around the coronavirus deepens mistrust between the US and China. With President Donald Trump warning that Washington would respond if Beijing intervenes against protests and democratic movements in Hong Kong, chances of a detente from last year’s trade war are fading.　Outside China, the big question is if the digital yuan is a challenger to the dollar. Within the country, though, there’s a more mundane explanation for why Beijing wants to turn banknotes in circulation into virtual tokens.　Chinese consumers have bypassed both computers and credit cards to embrace mobile payment apps, which have gone on to spawn large money-market funds investing in high-yielding wealth-management products. This has led to the accumulation of risks in opaque shadow banking. Bringing them out in the open requires a leg up for traditional lenders in payments, an area where financial technology has left them far behind. The digital yuan, which will be pushed out to consumers via banks, seeks to restore this missing balance; it will allow authorities to “regulate an overstretched debt market more effectively,” says DBS Group Holdings economist Nathan Chow.　Still, there’s also a power play. It isn’t a coincidence that China’s project picked up speed last year as Facebook Inc. announced Libra. The proposed stablecoin promised to hold its value against a basket of major official currencies rather than gyrating wildly like Bitcoin. When it looked like regulators in the US and elsewhere would nix this synthetic global cryptocurrency, the Libra Association curbed the scope of its undertaking. But the idea of “a regulated global network for cost-effective retail payments,” as described by Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings, a new member of Libra’s Geneva-based governing body, remains alive. For Beijing to shake the dollar’s hegemony, it has to preempt Silicon Valley from taking the pole position.Hence the hurry for China’s test runs. According to media reports, half the May transport subsidy for Suzhou municipal employees will be in the form of digital currency electronic payment, or DCEP. The pilot plan in Xiong’on, a satellite city of Beijing, includes coffee shops, fast food, retailers, theaters and bookstores, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has noted. The other trials are reserved for Chengdu and Shenzhen.Thanks to Alipay and WeChat Pay, 80 percent of Chinese smartphone users whip out their mobiles to make payments, more than anywhere in the world. To them, the DCEP wallets being provided by the big four state banks should seem much the same. But there are differences. In this new system, a low-value transaction can go through even if both parties are offline. Also, this is sovereign liability, safe if an intermediary goes bankrupt. The big four lenders -- and later fintech firms -- will distribute the tokens, but the funds won’t reside in bank accounts. This will be unlike existing payment apps that only move one institution’s IOUs to another.　Beijing was going to launch the digital money even before the pandemic. However, adoption could be faster now because of people’s fear of catching an infection from handling cash. Also, it’s possible to trace in real time whether an anti-virus subsidy, given out in tokenized form, is reaching the target. Once it has, the tracking would be “turned off” to ensure corporate and household spending stays anonymous, Goldman says.　Strictly speaking, though, the anonymity of cash will no longer exist. Authorities can look under the hood of pseudonymous transactions for unwanted activity. With the outbreak giving legitimacy to intrusive physical contact tracing, the case for financial tracing gets even stronger. Exchange of digital yuan between customers and merchants will pop up on a centralized ledger, and go through far more swiftly than in Bitcoin-style setups that rely on widely distributed ledgers of asset ownership.　Every nation projects power when others desire its money -- something that costs the home country nothing to produce. But as with any digital network, the sovereign tokens that take off first could end up winning disproportionately. The digital yuan could find customers overseas, especially in places where China is making belt-and-road investments. For one thing, they wouldn’t have to pay banks fat fees for running the $124 trillion-a-year business-to-business international transfers market.　By distributing digital currency through banks, China has given its big institutions a chance to match the payment technology of fintech rivals. But it’s possible that a central bank in another country would bypass intermediaries altogether, potentially making the state the monopoly supplier of money to retail customers. That, as I wrote in December, could upend banking. The digital yuan may have started modestly, but it might pave the way for changes that are both ambitious and long outlast the coronavirus.Andy MukherjeeAndy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services. -- Ed.(Bloomberg)[네이버에서 코리아헤럴드 구독]▶ KH Podcast     ▶ KH Video<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=044&aid=0000218502
2020.04.27.	edaily	KB국민카드, 태국 '제이핀테크' 신주인수 계약	KB금융그룹 주요 계열사 태국 시장 진출 교두보 역할 기대[이데일리 김유성 기자] KB국민카드가 국내 여신전문금융회사 최초로 태국 소비자 금융 시장에 진출한다고 27일 밝혔다. KB국민카드는 이날(27일) 신용대출, 자동차대출 등 소비자 금융 사업을 영위하는 태국 여신전문금융회사 ‘제이 핀테크(J Fintech)’지분 인수를 위한‘신주인수계약(SSA : Share Subscription Agreement)’을 맺었다. 27일 서울 종로구 KB국민카드 본사에서 온라인 화상 계약 방식으로 진행된 태국 여신전문금융회사‘제이 핀테크(J Fintech)’지분 인수 계약식 후 이동철 KB국민카드 사장(왼쪽)이 아디삭 수쿰비타야(Adisak Sukumvitaya) ‘제이마트 그룹(Jaymart Group)’ 회장과 기념 촬영을 하고 있다. (KB국민카드 제공)이번 계약은 ‘신종 코로나바이러스 감염증(코로나19)’의 영향으로 한국과 태국 모두 외국인에 대한 입국 제한 조치가 취해진 상황이었다. 이에 양사는 서울과 방콕을 온라인으로 연결해 화상 계약 방식으로 진행했다.제이핀테크는 태국 내 휴대전화 유통과 채권 추심 1위 업체를 계열사로 보유한 ‘제이마트(Jaymart)’ 그룹의 금융 자회사로 신용대출, 자동차대출 등 대출 사업과 신용카드 사업을 한다.  2011년 설립된 이 회사는 임직원 130여 명에 18개 영업소를 보유하고 있다. 지난해 말 기준 총자산 1516억 원, 당기순이익 26억 원을 기록한 중견 여신전문금융회사다. 총 인수 대금은 248억원(6억5000만바트)으로 KB국민카드는 ‘제이 핀테크’의 의결권 지분 50.99%를 보유하게 된다. 이번 계약은 이동철 사장 부임 이후 진행된 캄보디아, 인도네시아에 이은 3번째 해외 금융회사 인수로 올 초 신년사에서 언급한 동남아시아 국가를 중심으로 한 해외 사업의 지속 확장 전략에도 한 층 가속도가 붙을 것으로 보인다.  KB국민카드 관계자는 “이번 진출은 1998년 국제통화기금(IMF) 사태 이후 국내 은행과 여신전문금융회사가 신규 인허가 또는 인수합병 등을 통해 태국에 진출한 최초의 사례”라면서 “향후 KB국민은행 등 KB금융그룹 주요 계열사들의 태국 시장 진출에도 교두보 역할을 수행할 것으로 기대된다”고 전했다. KB국민카드는 한국과 태국 금융 당국의 승인 절차와 인수 계약을 마무리하는 ‘딜 클로징(Deal Closing)’등을 거쳐 이르면 연말께 공식 자회사로 편입할 계획이다. 태국 소비자 금융 시장은 2018년 기준 약 410조 원 규모로 추산되며 최근 5년 평균 8%에 이르는 안정적인 성장세를 이어가고 있다, 또 동남아시아 최고 수준의 신용 인프라를 구축하고 있고 정부의 ‘캐시리스(Cashless)’ 정책에 힘입어 신용카드 시장도 연 평균 7% 이상 성장하는 등 신용카드를 비롯해 각종 신용 사업이 용이한 것으로 평가 받고 있다.  KB국민카드는 자회사 편입 후 본사의 지급 보증 등을 통한 자금 조달로 차입 비용 절감을 도모하고 기존 보유 자산의 건전성을 높이는 등 우량 자산 중심의 포트폴리오 재편 작업을 진행할 계획이다. 영업 인프라 강화와 영업 채널 다각화를 위해 ‘제이마트’ 그룹의 자회사인 ‘제이마트 모바일’이 보유한 전국 192개 매장을 ‘전속시장(Captive Market)’으로 활용하고 전국 주요 거점 지역을 중심으로 영업소도 지속적으로 확대해 나갈 예정이다. 또 KB국민카드의 축적된 △상품 △디지털 △정보기술(IT) 관련 노하우를 바탕으로 현지 고객에 최적화된 신용 대출 신상품과 다양한 디지털 기반의 상품을 선 보이고 중장기적으로 신용카드 시장 진출을 도모해 수익성을 한 층 끌어 올릴 계획이다. KB국민카드가 보유한 리스크 관련 핵심 역량도 현지에 이전해 정교한 자체 신용평가 모델을 개발하는 등 체계적인 리스크 관리도 시도한다.김유성 (kys401@edaily.co.kr)네이버에서 ‘이데일리’ 구독하기▶청춘뉘우스~ 스냅타임▶＜ⓒ종합 경제정보 미디어 이데일리 - 무단전재 & 재배포 금지＞	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=018&aid=0004628175

2020.06.22.	코리아헤럴드	[Banks of Future] With online banks rising, financial giants gear up for digital transformation	Shinhan Financial Group Chairman Cho Yong-byoung speaks at an event for the banking group’s startup accelerator program “Shinhan Future’s Lab” in Seoul on Nov. 14. (Shinhan Financial Group)The prolonged COVID-19 pandemic has taken its toll on domestic banks this year, with lower interest rate margins and enhanced loan regulations.The key challenge, however, is not the tangible loss so far, but rather the forthcoming competition in the digital arena -- where conventional financial firms find themselves overrun by big tech rivals.Racing against the clock, the conventional financial industry is now scrambling to grab the digital initiative, in line with the ongoing deregulatory moves of authorities to activate digital innovation for sustainable growth.“From now on, the (financial) market will be reorganized into competition between financial and big tech firms,” said Financial Services Commission Chairman Eun Sung-soo in a recent press conference on the government’s financial policy directions in the second half of the year.“(Conventional financial companies) should contemplate the threats and opportunities that arise from such change."The Korea Institute of Finance also underlined in its recent report that banks are currently facing a watershed moment, pressed both by the general economic downturn and the paradigm shift in the sector.The loan-deposit margin -- indicating the gap between the interest rates of loans and deposits -- stood at 1.60 percent as of end-April, the lowest since December 2008, when the global financial crisis broke out. The net interest margin for the first quarter this year also came to a record-low of 1.46 percent.“Bank loans have expanded since March as companies sought to secure liquidity amid market uncertainties, but demand is expected to shrink in the second half, unless the economy has a dramatic rebound,” the report said citing the profitability challenges of banks.Also, noting the imminent market changes such as the kick-off of the MyData business, expansion of the open banking service, and the rise of big tech players, the think tank warned banks to exert all efforts for digital transformation.“Mega-sized platform operators such as Naver and Kakao are progressing at a face speed in the financial market, on the back of their simplified payment and remittance systems,” it said.Big players on the moveMajor banking groups here have been launching special committees and rolling out detailed plans tied to their digitalization businesses in recent weeks. Shinhan Financial Group said it has decided to officially pursue its digitalization project Digilog in line with the government’s “Digital New Deal” and to become a leader in adopting digital finance among its peers. The group held a management meeting on Wednesday to review four key businesses for the digitalization project. It has also launched a Digilog Committee -- chaired by the group’s Chairman Cho Yong-byoung and consisting of top executives of its seven subsidiaries -- to focus on its digital projects including its data and startup nurturing businesses. The committee plans to focus on materializing 35 specific plans under the project. To add momentum to its digitalization, four more subsidiaries were tasked with goals of coming up with new business models in different areas of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain and health care. In March, the group ordered six of its subsidiaries -- including its flagship Shinhan Bank, Shinhan Card and its insurance units -- to map out new business models in technologies they were assigned. The four new subsidiaries that joined the task included Shinhan Capital and Jeju Bank. The group’s research and development center, Shinhan Digital Innovation Institute, will be expanded and a digital education system will be established to hire and foster workforce centered on digital transformation, it said. Shinhan’s rival Woori Financial Group -- which launched a new vision for digitalization earlier in the year “digital for better life” and established a digital innovation committee in April -- has selected 15 tech startups for partnerships in technology and services, it said on June 2. Startups that provide online real estate data, wireless payment solutions and digital asset management platform were among those selected for the program dubbed Digital Innovation Lab.Woori Financial Group Chairman Sohn Tae-seung recently labeled the current timeframe as “the golden time for digital innovation as the “untact” (non-face-to-face contact) trend has evolved into the new normal due to the COVID-19 outbreak.” Hana Financial Group’s flagship banking unit has also partnered with 14 firms as part of its startup partnership and fostering program, established in 2015. While the startup program itself has existed for several years, this year’s selection process was centered on finding firms that could provide untact technology in its partnership. KB Kookmin has been expanding its digital finance services based on its partnership with Amazon Web Services -- Amazon’s cloud computing subsidiary -- and received approval from the state-run Financial Security Institute regarding the safety of its services. The FSI is an independent agency tasked with bolstering information management and protection. MyData test pilotsKorea’s financial groups are adding significant momentum to the growth of personal credit information management services here dubbed MyData, a new data-driven industry fostered by the government.MyData refers to a business model that offers integrated management of personal credit information such as banking transactions or credit card records and make personalized product recommendations to customers. JB Financial Group said Monday it has been selected to lead a consortium of financial companies to take part in the government’s MyData project. It is a state-led pilot test of MyData services in various industry sectors, aimed to strengthen individuals’ authority to control and handle their own information. In March, the Ministry of Science and ICT and related ministries began to recruit local companies hoping to participate in the pilot program. A total of 31 consortiums applied for the program and the ministry selected eight consortiums out of them, respectively specialized in six different fields – health care, finance, public transportation, welfare, small enterprises and traffic, officials said. A consortium led by JB Financial Group -- which consists of the group’s affiliates including Jeonbuk and Kwangju banks as well as JB Woori Capital alongside SK Group’s key affiliates including SK Telecom, SK Networks and SK Energy as well as Fintech, an online-based lending solutions provider -- was chosen as the MyData operator in the finance sector.Through the pilot project, JB Financial plans to develop personalized financial products and services by making use of vast amounts of mobility data of customers, including records of visits to gas stations, vehicle inspection or recent driving routes, the group said. Earlier, a consortium of NH NongHyup’s key finance units and local data firm SNP Lab was selected to develop an open platform for personal asset management.Meanwhile, in 2018, responding to the “fourth industrial revolution” driven by digital technology, the Korean government had announced plans to foster the country’s data industry by 2022 and the on-going MyData project was one of them. Taking effect in August, a revised credit information act that eases regulations on the use of personal information for businesses will provide a legal framework for the country’s MyData services in Korea. By Bae Hyun-jung, Jung Min-kyung and Choi Jae-hee(tellme@heraldcorp.com) (mkjung@heraldcorp.com) (cjh@hearldcorp.com)[네이버에서 코리아헤럴드 구독]▶ KH Podcast     ▶ KH Video<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000219317
2020.06.08.	코리아헤럴드	Authorities to open up public financial database to public for innovation	Financial Services Commission headquarters (Yonhap)As part of its move to nurture the data-based financial industry and financial technology businesses, Korea’s financial authorities will open up 44.5 million pieces of public financial data to the public for free, starting Wednesday, regulator Financial Services Commission said Monday.The range of public financial data consists of large sets of information stored at the FSC and eight other public financial institutions in Korea -- the Financial Supervisory Service, the Korea Development Bank, the Industrial Bank of Korea, the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund, the Korea Securities Depository, the Korea Asset Management Corporation, the Korea Housing Finance Corporation and the Korea Inclusive Finance Agency.Among the new data, some 580,000 cases of financial information about nonlisted firms -- such as the state-run lender Korea Development Bank and Industrial Bank of Korea will be made public for the first time -- which includes data on corporate governance and financial soundness, the FSC said. Meanwhile, listed firms are obligated to report their financial data to the financial watchdog via the FSS’ online-based data analysis, retrieval and transfer system, according to the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies. However, nonlisted firms here have been excused from such disclosure of corporate information since they are not subject to audit practices. Earlier, the financial regulator ran a pilot test in April, offering public financial data to fintech firms and startups as well as research institutions. A total of 46,739 pieces of information were in use as of this month, according to the FSC.“The opening of public financial big data will foster fintech firms’ data-driven innovative services,” an FSC official said. “The FSC will step up efforts to increase the number of financial institutions participating in the open financial big data system.”Further information on public financial data may be found at the public data portal (http://www.data.go.kr).By Choi Jae-hee (cjh@heraldcorp.com)[네이버에서 코리아헤럴드 구독]▶ KH Podcast     ▶ KH Video<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000218907
2020.06.16.	매경닷컴	Korean banks, credit card firms team up to entice users with high-yield savings plans	South Korean banks are teaming up with credit card issuers to keep customers from migrating to big tech players like Naver and Kakao that are eager to expand their financial footprint.Shinhan Financial Group on Monday released an installment savings account that offers an annual interest rate of up to 8.3 percent. The base rate is 1.2 percent, and customers can receive an additional 0.3 percent each if their account is set to automatic transfer or if they haven’t owned an installment savings account in the past three months. By meeting other requirements, such as signing up for a Shinhan card or insurance plan, they can receive up to 6.5 percent in Shinhan points or cashback rewards. Maturity is six months, with monthly installment capped to 300,000 won ($249).  Samsung Card and SC Cheil Bank also started selling a special installment savings plan with an annual interest rate of up to 7 percent. With a 1.6 percent base rate, the product offers 5.4 percent in cashback if new subscribers of Samsung Card or SC Cheil Bank affiliate cards hit a minimum level of monthly credit card payments. The plan is for 12 months, with the monthly installment ceiling set to either 100,000 won or 250,000 won. Samsung Card also joined forces with the Korea Federation of Community Credit Cooperative to launch a savings plan that offers up to 6 to 7 percent annual interest. Hyundai Card and Woori Bank introduced an installment plan that starts at a base annual rate of 1.7 percent but could reach up to 5.7 percent if certain conditions are met. Such partnerships come in the backdrop of the record-low interest rate environment. Korea’s benchmark rate currently stands at an all-time low of 0.50 percent after a 25-basis-point cut last month. The low returns have prompted many to cancel their savings accounts. During the February-May period, early withdrawals from savings accounts of the country’s four major lenders totaled 21.8 trillion won, up 15.5 percent from the same period a year earlier. The increasing foray of Naver and Kakao into the fintech market has also stoked anxiety among traditional financial players. Naver Financial, a subsidiary of Naver, operator of the country’s largest search engine, released an account earlier this month with Mirae Asset Daewoo that provides up to 3 percent in annual interest, which could reach 9 percent when including point rewards. Kakao, which runs Korea’s most popular messenger app, launched its own bank subsidiary in 2017 and has since ramped up its fintech expansion. Earlier this year, it acquired Baro Investment & Securities, a local brokerage house, to start offering stock-trading services on its mobile platform.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=009&aid=0004596310

2020.06.25.	조선일보	Online Retailer Coupang Frantically Woos New Staff	Online retailer Coupang is offering experienced technicians a W50 million signing bonus if they come to work for it amid a surge in business during coronavirus lockdown (US$1=W1,203).A signing bonus is highly unusual in Korea, and a similar move made headline last year when fintech start-up Viva Republica, which operates mobile payment platform Toss, hired experienced workers for a signing bonus equal to an annual salary in their last job and a promised salary 1.5 times higher than that.Coupang on Thursday said it wants to hire some 200 tech talents with over five years of experience like Android and iOS developers, product designers, and information security engineers.Coupang explained the idea behind what some might see as blatant poaching. "We expect a lot of applications, but we decided to offer a signing bonus out of our need to recruit the best of the best," it said.Coupang's sales benefited from soaring demand during lockdown and hired 20,000 new workers in the first quarter of this year alone.[By Choi Won-woo] 	Copyright ⓒ Chosunilbo & Chosun.com	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=023&aid=0003541717

[머니투데이 김사무엘 기자]  더존비즈온 을지타워 전경. /사진제공=더존비즈온문재인 대통령이 한국판 뉴딜 현장으로 18일 방문한 ERP(전사적 자원관리) 업체 더존비즈온에 시장의 관심이 쏠린다.더존비즈온은 회계, 세무, 인사 등 회사의 자원을 관리하는 프로그램인 ERP를 개발하고 서비스하는 B2B(기업 간 거래) 기업이다. 외국계 업체들이 점령한 국내 ERP 시장에서 거의 유일하게 활약하고 있는 토종 업체다.주요 제품은 △중소기업용 회계프로그램 '더존 Smart A(스마트 에이)' △기업용 표준형 ERP인 '더존 iCUBE(아이큐브)' △기업용 확장형 ERP인 '더존 ERP iU(아이유)' 등이 있다.지난해 5월에는 '실시간 회계 빅데이터를 이용한 AI(인공지능) 신용정보 서비스'가 금융위원회의 혁신금융서비스로 지정되기도 했다. 이는 기업들의 회계 정보를 AI기법으로 분석해 해당 기업의 신용 정보를 금융기관에 제공하는 서비스다. 기업은 이를 통해 금융기관으로부터 보다 수월하게 대출을 받을 수 있다.더존비즈온은 국내 핀테크(fintech·금융기술) 분야의 선두주자로 매년 20~30% 고성장을 이어가고 있다. 지난해 매출액은 전년 대비 15.8% 증가한 2627억원, 영업이익은 23.7% 증가한 668억원을 기록했다. 에프앤가이드에 따르면 올해 예상 매출액은 전년 대비 15.2% 증가한 3027억원, 영업이익은 18.1% 늘어난 789억원이다.최근 정부가 한국판 뉴딜의 핵심 사업 중 하나로 디지털 인프라와 비대면 산업 육성 방침을 밝히면서 더존비즈온이 수혜를 입을 것이란 전망이 나온다. 이민아 대신증권 연구원은 "코로나19(COVID-19) 영향으로 기업들의 재택근무 환경 조성에 대한 수요가 증가하면서 기존 ERP 고객의 클라우드(인터넷 가상 저장공간) 전환은 점차 가속화할 것"이라며 "신규 상품 매출이 본격적으로 반영되는 내년 실적 개선은 더욱 두드러질 전망"이라고 분석했다.김사무엘 기자 samuel@mt.co.kr▶줄리아 투자노트▶조 변호사의 가정상담소 ▶머니투데이 구독하기 <저작권자 ⓒ '돈이 보이는 리얼타임 뉴스' 머니투데이, 무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=008&aid=0004427001
2020.06.18.	매경닷컴	문 대통령, 한국판 뉴딜 첫 행보로 더존비즈온 전격 방문…데이터 중심 경제혁신 강조	문재인 대통령이 18일 데이터·AI 전문기업인 더존비즈온을 찾아 데이터 중심의 경제 혁신 의지를 강조했다. 데이터 산업 육성은 집권 후반기 국정 비전으로 제시한 '한국판 뉴딜'의 핵심 과제로 꼽힌다. '한국판 뉴딜'과 관련한 문 대통령의 경제 행보는 이번이 첫 번째다.더존비즈온은 회계, 세무, 인사 등 회사의 자원을 관리하는 프로그램인 ERP를 개발하고 서비스하는 B2B(기업 간 거래) 기업이다. 더존비즈온은 코로나19 국면에서 중소기업들을 위해 비대면 서비스 플랫폼을 무상 공급하며 지역 경제 활성화와 상생에 기여했다는 평가를 받는다. 지난해 5월에는 '실시간 회계 빅데이터를 이용한 AI(인공지능) 신용정보 서비스'가 금융위원회의 혁신금융서비스로 지정되기도 했다. 기업들의 회계 정보를 AI기법으로 분석해 해당 기업의 신용 정보를 금융기관에 제공하는 서비스다. 기업은 이를 통해 금융기관으로부터 보다 수월하게 대출을 받을 수 있다. 문 대통령은 현장 방문을 통해 데이터·AI를 통해 새로운 기회와 양질의 미래 일자리를 창출하는 '21세기 디지털 뉴딜'을 민·관이 합심해 신속히 추진해 나가야 한다고 강조했다.더존비즈온은 국내 핀테크(fintech·금융기술) 분야의 선두주자로 매년 20~30% 고성장을 이어가고 있다. 지난해 매출액은 전년 대비 15.8% 증가한 2627억원, 영업이익은 23.7% 증가한 668억원을 기록했다.최근 정부가 한국판 뉴딜의 핵심 사업 중 하나로 디지털 인프라와 비대면 산업 육성 방침을 밝히면서 더존비즈온이 수혜를 입을 것이란 전망이 나온다. 문재인 정부는 오는 2022년까지 디지털 뉴딜에 13조4000억원을 투입해 약 33만개의 일자리를 창출하겠다는 계획이다. 정부는 오는 7월 디지털 뉴딜을 포함한 '한국판 뉴딜 종합계획'을 발표할 예정이다.한편 리딩투자증권은 이날 더존비즈온에 대해 구사업 안정성과 신사업 성장성을 확인했다고 평가했다. 투자의견은 '매수', 목표주가는 11만1000원에서 13만3000원으로 올렸다.오승택 리딩투자증권 연구원은 "오는 2분기 매출액은 전년 동기 대비 16.9% 늘어난 매출액 726억원, 영업이익은 20.0% 증가한 183억원을 전망한다"며 "ERP(전사적자원관리) 부문은 9.7% 성장한 384억원이 전망되는데, 이는 작년 현대백화점, 동서발전 등을 기반으로 한 'D_ERP'(차세대 ERP)의 신규 수주 호조가 이어지고 있기 때문"이라고 설명했다.

Prime Ventures[http://www.primeventures.com/ ]와 Partech Partners[https://partechpartners.com/ ]는 세계은행그룹 회원사인 IFC[http://www.ifc.org/ ]와 함께 TerraPay에 공동 투자하고 있다. 이들 투자자는 Comviva의 주식을 매수하는 한편, TerraPay의 확장을 지원하고자 960만 달러의 추가 투자를 결정했다. 2015년 Comviva가 설립한 TerraPay는 전 세계 사람들이 신속하고 안전하며 저렴하게 송금할 수 있도록 지원하는 결제 기반시설 서비스를 제공한다. 이를 위해 TerraPay는 은행, 모바일 머니 업체, 송금 업체 또는 기타 결제 업체 같은 결제 서비스 공급업체가 저렴한 비용으로 즉각적으로 서로 연결되도록 지원한다. TerraPay는 2015년 설립 이후 아프리카, 아시아 및 유럽 60개국 이상에서 사업할 수 있는 허가증을 25개 이상 발급받았으며, 국제적으로 확장 중이다. TerraPay 설립자 겸 CEO Ambar Sur는 "자사의 사명은 모두에게 실시간 국가, 지역 및 국제 결제 접근성을 제공함으로써 금융 포용을 실현하는 것"이라며 "유명 투자자로부터 이와 같이 확인을 받은 것을 기쁘게 생각한다. 앞으로도 빠르게 성장하는 한편, 서비스가 불충분한 세계 대부분의 지역까지 진출할 계획"이라고 밝혔다.신규 투자자 컨소시엄은 TerraPay가 통신사와 모바일 머니 업체 간에 상호운용 실시간 국제 거래를 지원하는 허브로 사업을 확장하는 전략을 시행하도록 지원할 예정이다. 이를 통해 TerraPay는 결제 기반시설 서비스를 확장함으로써 국제 결제를 더 빠르게 허가 및 처리하며, 통신사 간 상호 운용되는 네트워크에 즉각적인 결제를 지원하며, 모바일 머니 계좌로의 송금을 방해하는 큰 장애물을 제거할 예정이다. 이 프로젝트는 저비용 전자 송금을 지원함으로써 정식 송금 결제 점유율을 높일 계획이다.Comviva CEO Manoranjan Mohapatra는 "자사는 기업 사업 전략의 핵심적인 부분으로 스타트업 모델을 양성하는 데 전념한다"라며 "TerraPay가 지난 5년 동안 이룬 발전에 자부심을 느낀다. 자사의 모든 양성 프로젝트에서 공통적인 철학은 고객, 지역사회, 주주 및 직원을 위한 큰 가치를 창출하는 것"이라고 말했다. 이어 그는 "TerraPay 프로젝트를 통해 신생업체를 성공적으로 양성하고, 유명 투자자를 유치하는 자사의 능력을 입증했다"라면서 "자사가 투자하는 솔루션은 자사의 사업 내에서 가치를 창출하거나 스스로 성장함으로써 제품 비전을 실현하는 한편, 주주를 위한 보람된 가치를 창출해야 한다. TerraPay의 추진 경로는 이와 같은 근본적인 목적과 맥락을 같이 한다"라고 설명했다.또한, Manoranjan Mohapatra는 "지난 수년 사이 국제 금융 거래 시장이 빠르게 변화했다"라며 "진화하는 규제 체제 때문에 TerraPay의 성장이 제한될 수밖에 없었고, 자사의 범위 밖으로 나갈 수밖에 없었다. 그로 인해 자사는 TerraPay 주식을 매각하는 전략적 결정에 도달했다. 이 변화는 모든 이해관계자를 위한 최선의 결정이라 확신한다. 앞으로도 이와 같은 전략적 프로젝트를 시행하고, 미래 성장을 추진하기 위한 신생 업체 공장을 이용할 것"이라고 덧붙였다.Prime Ventures 파트너 Pieter Welten은 "TerraPay는 매력적인 투자 기회"라며 "TerraPay는 강하고 노련한 경영진으로 인해 독특한 시장 입지를 점했으며, 허가증과 규제 승인, 세계적 수준의 디지털 결제 플랫폼 및 세계적인 파트너 네트워크로 구성된 강력한 경제 해자를 보유하고 있다. TerraPay는 자사의 투자를 통해 사업을 더 확대하고 확장할 것"이라고 말했다.IFC 금융기관 그룹 글로벌 이사 Paulo de Bolle은 "TerraPay를 자사의 성장하는 핀테크 투자 포트폴리오에 추가함으로써 TerraPay의 성장과 확장을 지원하는 한편, 비용을 낮추고, 고국으로 송금하는 과정을 간소화하는 데 일조하게 되었다"라며 "TerraPay와 같은 핀테크 업체는 신흥 시장에서 금융 포용을 높이는 데 매우 중요한 역할을 수행한다"라고 말했다.Partech Africa 사장 Cyril Collon은 "TerraPay의 다음 여정을 위해 우수한 투자자 그룹 및 훌륭한 팀과 협력하게 된 것을 기쁘게 생각한다"면서 "TerraPay 팀이 개발한 첨단 플랫폼에서 깊은 인상을 받았다. 이 플랫폼은 진정한 금융 포용에 필요한 상호운용성 목표를 달성하는 데 핵심적인 역할을 수행할 것이다. 이 플랫폼은 서비스의 품질, 신뢰도 및 속도 측면에서 최종 고객에게 이미 엄청난 영향을 미치고 있다"라고 설명했다.TerraPay의 스토리는 Comviva의 핵심적인 사람 철학을 반영한다. Comviva는 새롭고 흥미진진한 아이디어를 양성하고, 리더십과 기업가 정신에 불을 피우도록 직원들을 끊임없이 장려한다. Comviva는 세계적 선두주자로서 전 세계에 혁신적인 디지털 경험을 제공하고자 하는 더 큰 비전을 추구하고 있다.TerraPay는 전문 투자 은행 Kempen & Co의 핀테크 M&A 팀과 네덜란드를 기반으로 하는 법률사무소 Van Doorne으로부터 자문을 받았다. 추가 정보 문의:    Sundeep Mehta    PR & Corporate Communications    연락처: +91-124-481-9000    이메일: pr@comviva.com로고 - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/995982/Comviva_Logo.jpg    Comviva Logo출처: ComvivaComviva Divests its Stake in TerraPay to Prime Ventures, Partech Partners and International Finance Corporation (IFC)-- TerraPay raises $9.6 million fund for company's expansionNEW DELHI, March 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Comviva [https://www.comviva.com/ ], the global leader in mobility solutions, has announced its divestment of stake in TerraPay [https://www.terrapay.com/ ], for an undisclosed amount to a consortium of global investors.Prime Ventures [http://www.primeventures.com/ ] and Partech Partners [https://partechpartners.com/ ] are co-investing in TerraPay, along with IFC [http://www.ifc.org/ ], a member of the World Bank Group. Apart from acquiring Comviva shares, the investors have further invested $9.6 million in TerraPay to fund the company's expansion.TerraPay, a company incubated by Comviva in 2015, provides Payment Infrastructure Services that help people around the world to transfer money quickly, safely, and affordably. The company does this by enabling payment service providers such as banks, mobile money operators, money transfer operators or other payment providers to instantly connect to each other at a low cost.

The driving philosophy of all our incubations is to create significant value for our customers, community, shareholders and employees.

TerraPay's forward path is in alignment with that underlying purpose.""Market for international money transactions has changed rapidly over the past few years. The evolving regulatory framework constrained the growth of TerraPay and made it imperative to step out of Comviva fold. We have taken a strategic decision to divest TerraPay business and are confident that this change is in the best interest of all the stakeholders. We shall continue to take such strategic initiatives and leverage our start-up factory for fueling future growth," further added Manoranjan Mohapatra.Pieter Welten, a Partner at Prime Ventures said: "We identified TerraPay as an attractive investment opportunity.

2020.06.08.	코리아중앙데일리	[NEWS IN FOCUS] Naver offers new account service	Non-financial firms are competitively introducing savings accounts in partnership with local financiers to gain a foothold in "techfin."      Techfin is industry jargon for when internet companies add financial services to their existing online or mobile platforms. Fintech, on the other hand, is when financial companies provide services through newly created internet platforms. Simpler-than-ever registration processes and higher-than-average interest rates compared to traditional banks are expected to appeal to young customers. Naver Financial, a Naver subsidiary, on Monday introduced its account service in partnership with Mirae Asset Daewoo. In the form of cash management account (CMA), the new service provides up to 3 percent interest to savings under 1 million won ($830). CMA accounts are a combination of savings and investment accounts usually provided by securities companies. They offer relatively high rates but don't offer the protections of a bank account.   Naver, operator of Korea’s most popular search engine, expects its strong affiliation with Naver Pay, the company’s mobile payment service, will help overcome the company’s latecomer position compared to Kakao.   Kakao, which operates KakaoTalk, has already jumped into the finance industry by launching its own bank subsidiary in 2017, which turned to profit last year. Kakao has been accelerating its finance expansion and acquired a local brokerage house early this year to offer stock-trading services.      Naver said its clients will benefit if they make transactions through Naver Pay when doing shopping online. If the client connects Naver Pay with the newly launched savings account to make transactions online, the account will offer an additional 3 percent of the transactions made through Naver Pay in loyalty points.   The 3 percent rate on the savings account will be offered without any condition until Aug. 31. Afterwards, the clients have to make at least 100,000 won in transactions through Naver Pay in the prior month in order to get the rate. If Naver Pay transactions are less than 100,000 won in the previous month, the account will only pay 1 percent.   “Naver Financial is trying to generate new value by embracing those who have been in the blind spot in terms of finance, such as small business owners or full-time housewives,” said Choi In-hyuk, head of Naver Financial. The strong affiliation with Naver Pay, which is directly engaged in online shopping activities, will allow for the collecting of meaningful data of its customers which can be later utilized to provide more precise recommendations, either of financial products or shopping items.   “Naver Financial is expected to create a synergy effect with Naver Pay through online shopping activities by collecting a massive amount of data ranging from the user shopping preferences to transaction method and the item delivery times,” said Hwang Hyun-joon, an analyst from DB Financial Investment.   “With the economy transitioning into a data economy, Naver Financial is expected to get an upper hand in this criteria, and is highly likely to generate additional business utilizing such data which will give them a premium in value compared to other techfin or fintech players.” SK Telecom, the nation’s No. 1 mobile carrier, announced Monday it will launch an online check account in partnership with state-run Korea Development Bank on June 15.      Through its financial subsidiary Finnq, the online account provides 2 percent interest to its subscribers on savings up to 2 million won.

[뉴시스]아이디어 구상에 만족하는 사람이라면 그는 사색가다. 기술 개발 후 특허출원에 만족하는 사람이라면 그는 발명가다. 아이디어와 기술을 양손에 쥐고 시장에 뛰어드는 순간 그는 기업가다. 세상에 없던 제품과 서비스를 정의하는 ‘개념설계(Concept Design)’ 역량을 갖추는 순간 그는 혁신기업가다. 선진국 따라잡기로 영화(榮華)를 누리던 한국 경제는 개념설계 역량이 부족해 위기에 처했다. 도전의 미덕은 자취를 감췄다. 그사이 중국의 ‘기술굴기’가 심상치 않다. 미국은 21세기에도 IT(정보기술)에서 성장 신화를 써내려가고 있다. 수십 년째 회자되던 샌드위치 위기론은 비로소 현실이 됐다. 한국 경제는 길을 잃은 걸까. 이즈음 소환할 인물이 오스트리아 출신 경제학자 조지프 슘페터(Joseph Schumpeter)다. 그는 일찍이 자본주의 시스템은 혁신기업가가 신제품과 새로운 비즈니스 모델로 도전하는 메커니즘을 품고 있다고 간파했다. 이정동 청와대 경제과학특별보좌관은 2019년 1월 30일 문재인 대통령을 만나 정부의 재정정책에 대해 “주머니를 키우는 건 케인스식으로 하고, 쓸 때는 슘페터식으로 혁신적으로 하는 게 좋다”고 말했다. 민간 부문 기술기업의 시행착오를 해소하는 데 재정을 지출해야 한다는 뜻이다. 민(民)과 관(官)을 무 자르듯 나누는 경제 통념과는 달리, 관은 혁신을 촉발하는 모태다. 그런 기준대로라면 서울시만 한 혁신의 조력자는 한국에 없다. 여기, 서울시 한복판에 혁신기업가들이 자유롭게 뛰어노는 핀테크(Fintech·금융과 IT 기술이 결합한 서비스) 창업 생태계가 있다. 엘리베이터를 타고 가다 옆 사무실 기업가와 아이디어를 교환하고, 아래 사무실 공무원을 찾아가 규제에 대해 허심탄회하게 대화하는 곳. 서울 여의도 위워크에 문을 연 ‘서울핀테크랩’이다.서울 한복판 공유 오피스에 둥지 튼 ‘핀테크 생태계’서울시는 2019년 10월 29일 서울 여의도 위워크 여의도역점에 서울핀테크랩을 개관했다. 사진은 공용 라운지 전경. [조영철 기자]2019년 10월 29일 오후 2시 위워크 여의도역점에서 열린 서울핀테크랩 개관식에는 박원순 서울시장이 상기된 표정으로 참석했다. 박 시장은 “2018년 4월 마포에 핀테크랩을 처음 개설했는데 당시 14개 기업, 85명에서 시작했다”며 “규모가 작다고 판단해 옮기면서 확장했고, 현재 70개 기업 600여 명이 입주한 공간으로 탈바꿈했다. 1년 반 만에 7배가 커진 셈”이라고 말했다. 서울핀테크랩은 위워크(WeWork) 여의도역점 4·5·6·8층 등 총 4개 층을 쓴다. 규모는 7782㎡에 달한다. 왜 위워크일까. 2019년 12월 3일 서울핀테크랩에서 만난 임국현 서울시 경제정책과 금융산업팀장은 “위워크는 한번 입주하면 전 세계 위워크 지점을 이용할 수 있다. 해외 사업을 고려할 때 각 입주기업이 누릴 효과가 아주 크다”면서 이렇게 부연했다. “젊은 세대 사이에 형성된 공유오피스 트렌드를 염두에 둔 점도 있다. 기업들 얘기를 들어보니 예전에는 직원을 채용했는데 막상 입사하기로 한 날 안 나타나는 일이 자주 있었다더라. 위워크에서는 그럴 일이 없다고 한다.” 여의도는 국내 금융 인력의 19.6%가 밀집해 있는 명실상부한 금융 산업 중심지다. 그중 서울핀테크랩이 있는 위워크 여의도역점은 인근에 지하철 5·9호선과 대규모 버스환승센터가 있어 발군의 접근성을 자랑한다. 또 국회와 금융감독원도 지척에 있다. 임 팀장은 “여의도에 있으면 각 금융권 사람들과 국내외 네트워크를 구축하기 쉽다”고 말했다. 입주기업으로 선정되면 1년간 사무 공간이 지원되며 심의를 통해 1년 연장이 가능하다. 또 사업화 진단, 비즈니스 모델 역량 강화, 투자 역량 고도화, 전문가 상담(법률, 특허) 등의 맞춤형 멘토링을 받는다. 회의실 등 기업 육성과 투자 유치 행사를 할 수 있는 공간과 네트워킹을 위한 공용 라운지 등도 ‘이용할 수 있다. 이에 더해 핀테크 스타트업 전문 육성기관인 K엑셀러레이터가 운영기관으로 참여했다.까다로운 선발 조건에 실력 갖춘 업체 입주서울핀테크랩에 입주한 대체투자 핀테크기업 ‘다크매터’의 송진구 한국 대표(가운데)와 직원들. [조영철 기자]혜택이 많고 상징성이 크다 보니 선발 조건도 까다로운 편이었다. 모집 대상은 창업 7년 이내 핀테크 기업 중 1억 원 이상 투자 유치 실적과 연매출 1억 원 이상, 직원 4인 이상 등 조건을 충족하는 국내·외 기업이다. 이는 반대로 말하면 국내·외에서 실력과 내공을 인정받은 스타트업들이 서울핀테크랩에 대거 입주했다는 방증이다. 서울핀테크랩에는 국내 46개사에 해외 24개사가 입주했다. 이 중 대체투자 핀테크 기업인 ‘다크매터(DarcMatter)’는 2014년 미국 뉴욕에서 본사를 설립한 업체다. 대체투자는 현금, 주식, 채권 등 전통 자산을 제외한 나머지 자산에 투자하는 방식을 뜻한다. 다크매터는 핀테크 플랫폼을 꾸려 그간 기관투자가 중심으로 이뤄졌던 대체투자의 문호를 개인투자가에게도 넓히는 데 주안점을 두고 있다. ‘2017 넥스트 머니 글로벌 핀테크(Next Money Global Fintech)’ 당시 ‘가장 성장하는 핀테크 기업’ 부문에서 우승하는 등 미국에서 먼저 주목받은 기업이다. 서울핀테크랩 입주를 택한 이유에 대해 송진구 다크매터 한국 대표는 “외국기업이라 한국의 모든 게 생소했다. 이곳에서는 서울시가 가진 광범위한 연결 고리를 활용할 수 있고, 한편으로 금감원 등 당국과 접촉할 기회도 많다. 또 여의도에 있는 모든 분이 우리 고객이니 매우 좋은 장소다”라고 말했다. 최근 누적 대출액 2000억 원을 돌파하며  P2P 업계에서 화제에 오른  ‘한국어음중개’도 서울핀테크랩에 입주했다. 곽기웅 대표가 서비스를 설명하고 있다. [조영철 기자]최근 누적 대출액 2000억 원을 돌파하며 P2P(Peer to Peer·개인 간 거래) 업계에서 화제에 오른 ‘한국어음중개’도 서울핀테크랩에 둥지를 틀었다. P2P 금융이란 기업이나 개인이 은행과 같은 금융기관을 거치지 않고 온라인 플랫폼을 통해 다수의 개인으로부터 돈을 빌리는 서비스를 일컫는다. 한국어음중개는 2017년 6월 P2P 플랫폼 나인티데이즈(90days)를 내놨다. 보통 중소기업이나 소상공인은 돈이 급하면 사채시장에서 어음할인(일명 와리깡)을 해 자금을 마련하곤 한다. 아무래도 고금리일 수밖에 없다. 이를 주목한 한국어음중개는 전자어음 시장을 온라인에 투명하게 공개하기로 했다. 이를 통해 중소기업, 소상공인들이 보유한 매출채권과 전자어음 등을 중금리 수준으로 온라인 투자자로부터 조달받도록 했다. 나인티데이즈라는 명칭은 보통 매출채권과 전자어음 할인 만기가 90일이라는 점에 착안했단다. 90일 내외 단기투자 상품이라 투자자의 수요도 많은 편이다. 또 일반인이 비상장 기업 투자 기회를 갖게 된 터라 투자시장 창출에도 기여했다. 최근 한국어음중개는 40억 원의 투자도 유치했다. 곽기웅 대표는 서울핀테크랩 입주를 택한 이유로 “서비스 특성상 금융기관과 제휴하고 협의해야 할 일이 굉장히 많다. 이곳에서는 스쳐가듯 만나더라도 아이디어 회의를 할 수 있다”고 말했다. 이어 “이곳에 P2P 업체도 몇 군데가 입주해 있다. 엘리베이터를 타고 올라가면서 최근 시장 동향이나 정책 당국과 협의한 내용도 공유한다. 특히 우리와는 성격이 다른 핀테크 회사들과 제휴해 새로운 걸 만들어내는 재미가 상당하다”고 덧붙였다.밀집한 덕에 시너지 효과도 기대서울핀테크랩에 입주한 ‘리걸 테크(Legal Tech)’ 기업 ‘아미쿠스렉스’의 정진숙 대표. [조영철 기자]도시가 경제성장에서 발휘하는 힘은 인구밀도가 높은 환경에서 비롯한다. 도시경제학자 에드워드 글레이저는 “도시에서 개인이 가진 지식과 능력이 자유롭게 교환되고 그 과정에서 학습이 이뤄지고 문명의 발전이 이뤄진다”(‘도시의 승리’ 中)고 했다. 장거리 이동과 커뮤니케이션 기술이 아무리 발달한다고 한들 가까이 머물며 면대면으로 생각과 가치를 교환하는 데 비할 바는 아니다. 그런 점에서 여의도와 위워크의 조합을 택한 서울시의 결정은 신의 한 수라 해도 무방하다. 공간으로 비즈니스 융합(convergence)을 꾀할 수 있는 판을 만들었기 때문이다. 서울핀테크랩 운영기관인 K엑셀러레이터의 신은욱 센터장은 “최근 들어 입주 기업들 간 업무협약(MOU)이 여럿 체결됐다. 우리가 미팅을 주선하기도 한다”고 귀띔했다. 리걸 테크(Legal Tech) 기업인 ‘아미쿠스렉스(Amicus Lex)’는 이른바 밀집 효과를 가장 크게 누릴 수 있는 업체다. 변호사인 정진숙 대표(사법연수원 44기)가 2015년 창업한 아미쿠스렉스는 법률(law)과 문서(form)를 결합한 ‘로폼’을 운영한다. 정 대표가 로펌 근무 당시 법에 문외한인 이용자에게 간편하고 쉬운 서비스를 제공하겠다는 생각을 품은 데서 시작됐다. 로폼에서는 이용자가 판례나 법령 등 기본 정보를 입력하면 10여 분 만에 자동으로 법률 문서가 작성된다. 내용증명이나 지급명령 신청 등 일반인이 이용하는 서비스도 제공된다. 물론 실제 로펌을 이용하는 것과는 비교할 수 없이 가격도 저렴하다. “법의 진정한 이념에 기술을 더해 모두가 차별받지 않는 법의 가치를 누리겠다”는 회사의 비전이 무색하지 않다. 정 대표는 “대기업과 달리 작은 기업의 경우 계약서 하나 쓰는 데도 샘플 찾고 변호사 찾는 데 어려움을 겪는다. 우리가 운영하는 로폼에는 스타트업에 필요한 각종 법률 문서를 모아놓은 ‘스타트업 필수문서’ 패키지가 있으니 핀테크 기업 등 다른 스타트업에 도움을 줄 수 있을 것 같다”고 말했다. 한편으로 아미쿠스렉스는 블록체인을 기반으로 비상장 기업의 주식을 거래할 수 있는 플랫폼을 선보일 예정이다. 세계 최대 핀테크 클러스터인 영국 런던의 ‘레벨39’ 입주기업들은 우리나라 금융위와 비슷한 금융감독청(FCA)을 감시자가 아니라 조력자로 생각한다. 공무원들이 늘 이곳으로 출근하다시피 찾아와 기업 직원들의 말 한마디 한마디에 귀를 기울이고 애로 사항을 해결해주기 때문이다. 서울핀테크랩이 지향하는 바도 같다. 임국현 서울시 금융산업팀장은 “시간만 나면 상주하는데, 공용 라운지에 있으면 기업인들이 찾아온다”고 전했다. 그는 “가령 모 기업이 금융결제원과 미팅을 하고 싶다고 하면 저희가 연락해 회의도 하고 업무협력을 끌어내는 식이다. 얼마 전에는 신용보증기금과 연계하고 싶다는 요청이 와서 제가 직접 기금 측에 연락해 미팅 자리도 마련했다”고 말했다.“공용 라운지에 있으면 기업인들 찾아와”서울핀테크랩에 입주한 ‘보난자팩토리’는 실명계좌 기반 입출금 서비스를 제공하는 기업이다. 신중원 대표(오른쪽 두번째)를 비롯한 직원들이 파이팅을 외치고 있다. [조영철 기자]박원순 시장은 서울핀테크랩 개관식에서 “특허청과 금감원이 서울핀테크랩에 현장 상담소를 운영하기로 했다. 큰 도움이 될 것”이라 말했다. 박 시장이 말을 마치자 입주기업 대표들의 큰 박수가 쏟아졌다. 그만큼 당국과의 커뮤니케이션에 목말라했다는 방증이다. 곽기웅 한국어음중개 대표는 “평상시에 만나기 힘든 금감원이나 특허청, 서울시 공무원들을 마치 옆 사무실 방문하듯 만날 수 있다”고 말했다. 이와 관련해서는 두 입주기업을 주목할 필요가 있다. ‘보난자팩토리’는 실명계좌 기반 입출금 서비스를 제공하는 기업이다. 2018년 한 해에만 유수 기관으로부터 미래성장동력 핵심 기술 기업(서울산업진흥원), 4차 산업혁명 특화, 전문화 기업(기술보증기금)으로 선정됐다. 금융·IT 분야에서 십수 년 경력을 지닌 전문 인력이 힘을 합친 덕이다. 이베스트투자증권 출신인 김영석 이사는 “차후 자금세탁방지 분야의 중요성이 커질 텐데 기존 사업자가 없으니 혁신적인 서비스에 도전해보자고 의기투합했다”고 말했다. 서비스의 골자는 이렇다. 암호화폐 거래소가 은행 계좌를 개설하면 보난자팩토리는 같은 은행에 개설된, 실명 확인된 개인 명의의 은행 계좌를 통해 암호화폐 거래소와 개인 고객 간 펌뱅킹(Firm Banking·컴퓨터를 매개로 하는 자금 이동 금융 서비스) 방식의 이체를 제공한다. 이때 각 제휴 암호화폐 거래소로부터 사고 이력 및 의심 고객군을 미리 통보받는다. 의심되는 사례라면 은행에 즉각 거절 사유를 통보한다. 신중원 대표의 표현대로라면 “금융 사고를 예방하기 위한 서비스”인 셈이다. 사업 모델의 특성상 아무래도 당국과의 접촉이 많을 수밖에 없다. 실제 보난자팩토리는 금융위원회에서 진행하는 규제샌드박스에 신청했고, 최근 위탁테스트까지 마쳤다. 금융위의 규제샌드박스는 그간 규제 탓에 금융시장에서 막혔던 새로운 서비스에 한해 일시적으로 규제를 풀어주는 제도다. 신 대표는 “처음 서비스를 준비할 때부터 금감원 자문단에 자문했다. 아마 금감원 자문단에 가장 많이 방문한 기업이 우리일 것”이라면서 “서울핀테크랩에 금감원과 특허청 공무원이 상주하는데, 큰 도움이 된다”고 말했다. ‘스몰티켓’은 보험과 기술의 합성어인 인슈테크(Insurtech) 기업이다. 보험은 특히 유통 비용이 많이 드는 산업이다. 판매 단계마다 발생하는 비용이 보험료를 상승시키는 요인이 된다. 아무래도 디지털 플랫폼을 활용하면 유통 비용이 절감될 수밖에 없다. 김정은 대표는 젊은 고객들의 경제 행동 패턴이 변했다는 점에 주목했다. 열쇳말은 ‘펫’과 ‘모빌리티’다. 주력 상품인 펫보험은 2019년 7월 금융위 혁신금융서비스로 지정됐다. 눈길 끄는 건 ‘리워드(보상)’다. 반려동물이 설정 목표(운동, 예방접종, 건강검진 등)만큼 건강해지면 포인트 혜택을 준다. 고객은 리워드를 스몰티켓과 제휴한 동물병원에서 사용할 수 있다. 최근 스몰티켓은 온디맨드(On-Demand·수요자가 원하는 물품이나 서비스를 바로 공급하는 비즈니스 모델) 형태의 시간단위 배달업자 이륜자동차보험을 선보였다. 젊은 세대 사이에 ‘파트타임’ 일자리가 많은 점에 착안했다. 즉 이륜차를 소유한 개인이 이를 활용해 영업 활동에 나설 때만 위험을 보장하는 방식이다. 김 대표는 “자동차 보험은 이미 성숙한 시장이다. 반면 ‘온디맨드 시간제 이륜차 보험’의 경우 대형 보험사가 발굴하기에는 규모가 작아 우리로서는 신 시장”이라고 말했다. 보험은 사업 특성상 규제 이슈에 민감할 수밖에 없다. 그러니 금감원과 특허청 공무원이 상주하는 서울핀테크랩은 최적의 공간인 셈. 김 대표는 “규제 당국이나 정책 당국이 신시장에 나타난 사업자들과 직접적으로 스킨십할 기회가 별로 없다”면서 이렇게 부연했다. “가까이 있으니 사업 소개할 기회가 많고, 해결됐으면 하는 부분도 제시할 수 있다. 공무원 입장에서도 어떤 서비스를 혁신이라고 해야 하는지, 어떤 정책 방향을 설정해야 하는지 고민하려면 직접 접해야 하지 않나. 각자(민·관)에게 도움이 되지 않을까 싶다.”‘죽음의 계곡(Death Valley)’ 넘기이정동 청와대 경제과학특보는 수많은 시행착오를 통해 아이디어를 사업화 단계로 키워가는 과정을 ‘스케일업(scale up)’이라 칭했다. 그러나 스케일업 과정에서 셀 수 없이 많은 스타트업이 ‘죽음의 계곡(Death Valley)’을 넘지 못한 채 고꾸라졌다. 스타트업이어서 자금이 필요하지만, 스타트업이라는 이유로 자금 조달에 어려움을 겪기 때문이다. 사업화에 성공하더라도 초기 자금이 바닥나 창업 3~4년 만에 폐업하는 스타트업도 부지기수다. 한국에서 유니콘(unicorn·기업 가치가 1조 원을 넘는 스타트업)이 좀체 탄생하지 못하는 데는 이와 같은 사정이 있다. 서울시 측도 이를 잘 알고 있다. 임국현 서울시 금융산업팀장의 말이다. “2020년에는 투자기관을 서울핀테크랩에 초청해 기업과 연결하려 한다. 70개 기업이 모여 있으니 장점도 있다. 투자사 입장에서도 기업 하나하나 찾아다니는 게 보통 일이 아닌데 서울핀테크랩에 오면 다 만날 수 있다. 또 저희가 입주 심사 과정에서 이미 한 번 각 기업들을 평가하고 검증했다. 이와 같은 여건을 바탕으로 기업들의 자금문제를 해결할 것이다.” 서울시의 꿈은 좀 더 넓은 데로 향하고 있다. 서울핀테크랩을 거점 삼아 여의도를 명실상부한 ‘아시아의 핀테크 중심지’로 담금질하겠다는 야심을 드러낸 것이다. 싱가포르와 미국 등 핀테크 산업에서 앞서가는 국가에 터를 잡은 기업들이 이미 서울핀테크랩에 모여들었다. 국내 기업은 해외로, 해외 기업은 서울핀테크랩으로 선순환하는 구조가 이뤄진다면 서울시의 꿈은 현실로 나타날 테다. 한국 경제가 ‘퍼스트 무버(First Mover)’로 탈바꿈하는 길목에 서울핀테크랩이 있다.고재석 기자 jayko@donga.com▶ 신동아 최신호 보기/정기구독 신청하기▶ 잡지의 핫이슈만 모았습니다 '매거진동아'	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=100&oid=262&aid=0000012763
2020.04.28.	연합뉴스	[PRNewswire] Surecomp(R), 무역 금융 API 위한 새로운 오픈 뱅킹 기준 정립	-- 고객에게 무료 체험 기회 제공(토론토 2020년 4월 28일 PRNewswire=연합뉴스) 은행과 기업을 위한 글로벌 무역 금융 솔루션을 제공하는 굴지의 기업 Surecomp(R)가 샌드박스 테스팅 환경에서 고객에게 제공할 API(Application Programming Interface) 아키텍처를 개방한다고 오늘 발표했다. 그에 따라, Surecomp는 무역 금융 처리와 연결성의 디지털화 부문에서 새로운 오픈 뱅킹 기준을 세웠다. 전 세계 은행에 제공되는 APIsure 서비스는 이미 유럽 최대 은행들이 은행의 지급보증과 신용장을 실시간으로 처리하는 데 사용하고 있다. 기존 고객은 제한된 기간에 API 샌드박스에서 무료로 이 서비스를 시험적으로 사용해볼 수 있다. 이는 코로나19 시대에 디지털화된 무역 금융의 중요성을 부각시킨다. 인정받는 업계 선구자인 Surecomp는 주요 은행들로부터 디지털 오픈 뱅킹 무역 금융으로 향하는 여정을 견인해달라는 요청을 받았다. 여러 은행과 전적으로 협력하며 설계한 APIsure는 가장 높은 보안, 컴플라이언스, 확장성, 모니터링 및 투명성 기준을 보장한다. 또한, API 관리 시스템(APM)과 API 샌드박스 외에 유연하고 민첩한 백오피스 연결성도 제공한다. 더불어 APIsure는 파트너가 앱과 서비스를 개발할 수 있는 개발자 포털도 포함하고 있다. 현 API는 데이터 분석과 시각화 서비스를 비롯해 생산성과 효율성도 지원한다. 앞으로는 첨단 위험 관리, 로봇 공정 자동화(Robotic Process Automation, RPA), KYC(Know Your Customer) 기능성, 컴플라이언스 등을 발전시킬 예정이다.여러 지역에서 오래전부터 Surecomp 고객이던 유럽 최대의 한 은행은 Conpend와 더불어 최초로 API를 시행했다. Conpend는 무역 금융 문서 디지털화 서비스를 제공하는 Surecomp의 핀테크 파트너 중 하나다. 그 결과, 레거시 장벽을 제거하는 한편, 뱅킹 업무의 효율성을 크게 높였다. 또한, 고객에게 무역 금융 서비스를 출시하는 시간을 단축시키고, 종이 기반 거래의 위험 노출을 줄였다. Surecomp 디지털화 VP Tsafrir Attar는 "세계 굴지의 은행들이 이미 합류함에 따라, 자사의 오픈 뱅킹 아키텍처가 무역 금융 처리의 판도를 바꿀 것으로 확신한다"라며 "고객에게 안전한 샌드박스 환경 내에서 API 연결성을 시험할 기회를 제공함으로써, 실시간 무서류 연결성 기준을 세우고, 이를 통해 무역 금융 에코시스템 전반에 걸쳐 은행, 기업 및 핀테크 기업을 위한 향상된 성장, 효율성, 고객 만족 및 협력을 도모하게 됐다"라고 설명했다.Surecomp 소개    Surecomp(R)는 은행과 기업을 위한 혁신적인 무역 금융 솔루션을 제공하는 글로벌 선도기업이다. 30년 넘게 시장 선구자로 존경받아온 Surecomp는 무역 금융, 공급망 금융 및 재무 솔루션으로 구성된 통합적인 포트폴리오를 제공하며, 운영 효율성을 높이고, 위험을 완화하며, 수익을 최대화하는 거래 라이프사이클을 간소화한다. 미국, 아르헨티나, 칠레, 영국, 독일, 이스라엘 및 싱가포르에서 7개의 개발지원센터로 구성된 글로벌 네트워크를 보유한 Surecomp는 6개 대륙 80개국 이상에서 일류 고객 기반에 제품과 서비스를 제공한다. 추가 정보는 웹사이트 surecomp.com/product/apisure를 참조한다.Surecomp 문의:    Abby Bickford    Director of Marketing    전화: +44-(0)7931-126616    이메일: abby.bickford@surecomp.com출처: SurecompSurecomp(R) Sets the New Open Banking Standard for Trade Finance APIs and Gives Free Trial to CustomersTORONTO, April 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Surecomp(R), the leading provider of global trade finance solutions for banks and corporates, today announced the opening of its Application Programming Interfaces (API) architecture to customers in a sandbox testing environment, setting the new open banking standard in the digitization of trade finance processing and connectivity.The APIsure service which is available to banks across the globe, is already being used by some of the largest banks in Europe for real-time processing of their bank guarantees and letters of credit.

[사진 셔터스톡]       신종 코로나 바이러스 감염증(코로나19) 확산을 막기 위한 대안으로 재택근무가 떠올랐지만, 국내 핀테크(FinTech·기술금융) 업계에선 '대못규제'로 이를 도입하기 어렵다는 지적이 나온다. 인터넷망을 '업무용'과 '비업무용'으로만 나누는 획일적인 전자금융감독규정이 원인이다. 도대체 핀테크업계는 왜 망을 두 개나 써야 하는 걸까.     ━   무슨 일이야?      · 지난 15일 국회에서 열린 '디지털 뉴딜과 보안 패러다임' 컨퍼런스에서 "망 분리 적용 의무가 핀테크 기업의 발목을 잡고 있다"는 주장이 나왔다.     · 금융기업은 망 분리 규제로 업무용 내부망에서 인터넷을 쓸 수 없다. 김승주 고려대 정보보호대학원 교수는 "일반 인터넷망이 필요한 클라우드 활용 업무방식이 확산하면서 내부망에 일시적으로 인터넷을 연결해주는 망 연계 제품도 써야하는 이중고가 생겼다"며 "망 분리 제품과 망 연계 제품이 동시에 팔리는 말도 안 되는 일이 반복되고 있다"고 지적했다.     · 데이터 중요도에 따라 망을 세분화해야 한다는 대안이 제시됐다. 망을 '업무용'과 '비업무용'으로 나누지 말고, '기밀용'과 '일반용'으로 나누자는 것. 이 경우 고객정보 등 기밀 데이터만 내부망에 넣어두면, 일반 업무는 자유롭게 볼 수 있다.     ━   망 분리가 뭔데?      · 현행 전자금융감독규정은 금융사와 전자금융업자가 일반 인터넷망과 분리된 '내부망'만 활용해 업무를 보도록 사전규제하고 있다.     · 디도스(DDoS) 등 외부 공격으로부터 내부 자료를 보호하기 위한 보안 기법이다.     · 내부망에선 클라우드는 물론, 개발자들에게 필요한 깃허브(github) 등의 오픈소스(무료 프로그래밍 코드) 공유 커뮤니티 활용이 어렵다. 자연히 재택근무도 힘들어진다. 모바일 업무도 볼 수 없다.     지난 15일 서울 여의도 국회의원회관에서 '포스트 코로나 시대의 디지털 뉴딜과 보안 패러다임' 컨퍼런스가 열렸다. [사진 스타트업얼라이언스]      ━   핀테크업계는 뭐래?      망 분리 조치가 정보기술(IT)을 기반으로 하는 핀테크의 특성을 이해 못하는 낡은 규제라고 지적한다. 규제를 풀어준다면 기업의 보안 책임 강화도 감수하겠다는 입장이다.     · 88.6%. 지난해 한국핀테크산업협회 조사에서 44개 협회 회원사 중 망 분리 규제 완화에 찬성한 비율이다. 망 분리에 반대하는 가장 큰 이유는 '업무 생산성 저하'였다.     · 금융위원회는 지난 2월 코로나19 비상 대책으로 재택근무 중인 금융사 직원 등에 한시적으로 망분리 예외를 인정했다.      · 신용석 토스(비바리퍼블리카) 최고정보보호책임자(CISO)는 "지난 4개월간 관련 문제가 없었다"며 "규제를 완화해도 다른 보안 대책이 적용되면 괜찮을 것"이라고 설명했다. 신 이사는 "기업이 보안 기술을 선택할 수 있게 하되, 과징금을 높이는 등 최종 책임도 확실하게 지우면 된다"고 주장했다.     · 앞선 조사에서 핀테크 스타트업의 70%가 "필요하다면 특정 분야에서 금융회사보다 더 높은 수준의 보안 통제를 적용하겠다"고 답했다.     ━   해외는?      · 미국·호주 등은 데이터 중요도에 따라 상중하 등급의 망을 따로 마련하는 망 세분화로 중요 정보를 보호하고 있다. 또 망 분리 적용은 법적 의무가 아닌 기업·기관의 선택이다. 보안 사고가 난 기업은 징벌적 손해배상제 등 강력한 사후책임을 지게 된다.     · 유럽 개인정보보호법(GDPR)은 2018년 영국 브리티시 항공사가 고객 개인정보 50만건을 유출했을 때 매출액의 1.5%에 해당하는 벌금 2700억원을 내게 했다. 이는 국내 개인정보 유출 사고 최고 과징금인 44억원보다 60배 많다.     핀테크 기업들은 '망분리 규제' 철폐를 요구한다. [사진 셔터스톡]      ━   금융당국 입장은?      신중한 입장이다. 금융 분야는 정보유출 등의 피해가 발생했을 때 국민의 대규모 재산상 피해로 이어질 가능성이 커서다.     · 15일 컨퍼런스에 참석한 이한진 금융위원회 전자금융과 과장은 "국내 망 분리 규제가 매우 센 것은 인정한다"며 "코로나19로 망 분리에 대한 근본적인 고민을 하고 있다"고 말했다. 하지만 "우리 금융 환경은 해외와 달리 상호호환성(금융회사 간 상호연동)이 높아 한 군데라도 뚫리면 큰 문제가 될 수 있다"고 우려했다.                 김정민 기자 kim.jungmin4@joonang.co.kr   ▶ 그래서, 팩트가 뭐야? 궁금하면 '팩플'▶ 세상 쉬운 내 돈 관리 '그게머니'▶ 그래픽으로 다 말해주마, 그래픽텔링ⓒ중앙일보(https://joongang.co.kr), 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=025&aid=0003010656
2020.06.19.	코리아중앙데일리	PayID aims to unify bank, bitcoin and mobile payments	The logo of PayID [RIPPLE]      A coalition lead by cryptocurrency company Ripple on Friday announced the launch of PayID, the world’s first open-source online payment system that allows users to transfer and receive cash across different platforms with one payment ID.    Users create a single ID, like “user$domain.com,” to receive money from banks, mobile transfer apps and even a bitcoin wallet, the company said, in order to simplify money transaction processes online.    While many options already exist for transferring money online, services remain heavily fractured and complicated. Banks typically require an account number, routing number and a complicated Swift code to transfer money overseas. For mobile cash transferring applications, transactions across different apps are not allowed. For example, only Paypal users can receive cash sent through Paypal, and those with Toss or Kakao Pay accounts cannot.     The underlying code for PayID is open source, allowing other payment services like Paypal, Toss or Venmo to integrate its code into their platforms.     Forty companies announced plans to participate under the Open Payment Coalition, which consists of multiple blockchain projects, payment gateways such as Flutterwave and the Indonesian fintech company Gojek. Combined, the partner companies account for about 100 million users.    Ripple said it provides an end-to-end travel rule compliance system that also satisfies both the requirements by the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the Financial Action Task Force. The travel rule is a strict new regulation that requires firms dealing with cryptocurrency transactions above a certain value to confirm the remitter's identity.    Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Coinone, will be the first Korean company to partner with the payment solution.        “PayID is expected not only to simplify the experience of money transfer but also to bring innovation to our daily financial lives in the long term. We will do our best to support its successful landing as a partner,” Coinone CEO Kevin Cha said.

[뉴스1]네이버가 또 비상한 점도 투자업계의 관심거리다. 5월 15일 네이버 주가는 21만3000원에 거래를 마쳤다. 시가총액은 34조9881억 원으로 코스피 시총 순위 4위를 기록했다. 반도체주인 삼성전자(1위), SK하이닉스(2위)와 바이오 대장주로 꼽히는 삼성바이오로직스(3위)만이 네이버를 앞섰다. 카카오와 마찬가지로 실적 성적표도 ‘수’다. 4월 23일 네이버는 올해 1분기 매출이 전년 동기 대비 14.6% 증가한 1조7321억 원, 영업이익은 같은 기간 7.4% 증가한 2215억 원을 기록했다고 밝혔다. 실적 발표 직전인 4월 초만 해도 일부 증권사는 1분기 네이버의 영업이익이 10% 이상 감소하리라는 리포트까지 내놓은 바 있다. 감염병 확산에 따라 대형 광고주들이 예산을 감축하면서 광고 매출이 직격탄을 맞으리라 봤기 때문이다. 상황을 반전으로 이끈 동력은 마찬가지로 코로나19다. 네이버에 따르면 온라인 쇼핑몰인 스마트스토어 거래액이 지난해 같은 기간에 비해 56% 증가했다. 또 월간 800만 명 수준이던 이용자 수는 지난 2월 900만 명, 3월 1000만 명으로 늘었다. 같은 기간 네이버페이 거래액은 46% 증가해 5조 원을 돌파했다. 네이버페이 분기 거래액이 5조 원을 넘어선 것은 이번이 처음이다. 네이버페이 월간 결제자 수는 1250만 명이었는데, 특히 50세 이상이 53%가 증가한 점이 눈길을 끈다. 코로나19로 그간 간편결제 서비스 사용에 소극적이던 장년층까지 새로운 수요로 등장했다는 뜻이기 때문이다. 웹툰 거래액도 전년 동기 대비 60%가 증가했다. 코로나19 확산으로 콘텐츠 소비가 늘어난 덕분으로 풀이된다. 한성숙 네이버 대표는 실적 발표 직후 “코로나19 확산은 마케팅 수요 감소 측면에서는 위기지만, 비대면 서비스 활성화 측면에서는 다양한 기회 요인”이라고 말했다. 김소혜 한화투자증권 연구원은 “네이버의 기업 가치가 크게 상승한 2014년과 2017년에는 모바일 메신저 라인이나 쇼핑 검색 광고와 같이 신규 수익모델 확장이라는 변수가 반영됐었다”며 “올해 영업이익 성장률은 50%로 역대 가장 높은 수준이 전망된다. 차기 성장 동력으로 꼽히던 클라우드, 라인웍스 등 B2B(기업 간 거래) 사업이 코로나19로 인해 더 빠르게 성장하는 등 언택트 확산이 긍정적 영향을 미치고 있다”고 말했다.‘재벌의 시금석’기업의 덩치가 커지면 견제론이 나올 수밖에 없다. 코로나19가 기회로 작용하면서 외려 대기업의 존재감을 확연히 드러낸 점도 양날의 검으로 되돌아올 수 있다. 카카오는 지난해 5월 처음 자산총액 10조 원을 넘겨 대기업집단(‘상호출자제한 기업집단’)에 포함됐다. 그런데 1년 새 카카오페이증권을 비롯해 계열사를 26개사나 늘려 자산총액 순위를 32위에서 23위로 끌어올렸다. ‘재벌의 시금석’으로 꼽히는 30대 그룹에 단숨에 진입한 셈이다. 현재 자산총액이 9조5000억 원 수준으로 41위인 네이버는 최근 상승세를 고려하면 내년 대기업집단에 포함될 전망이다. 공정위는 자산총액 10조 원 이상인 대기업에 대해서는 상호·순환 출자 금지, 채무보증 금지, 금융·보험사 의결권 제한 규제 등을 적용한다. 오너 일가로 경제력 집중을 막기 위한 조치다. 정작 이 와중에 카카오와 네이버는 신사업으로 계속 진군하면서 ‘문어발식 확장’ 전략을 펴고 있다. 특히 금융 분야로의 확장이 눈에 띈다. 금융은 산업 속성상 규제 이슈에 노출돼 있을 수밖에 없다. 네이버는 5월 말 네이버통장을 시작으로 연내 보험·주식 서비스를 내놓을 계획이다. 앞서 지난 2월 6일 카카오는 카카오페이를 통해 바로투자증권의 계열사 편입을 완료하고 사명을 ‘카카오페이증권’으로 바꾼 바 있다. 금융 당국 출신의 한 자본시장 관계자는 “과거 핀테크(FinTech·금융+정보기술) 사업에 진출하려던 대기업들도 사외이사 등 직책에 금융 당국 출신을 영입한 경우가 있었다”면서 “최근 포털업체로 금융 당국 출신이 이직한 경우가 있는데, 뒤집어 말하면 각 업체들이 규제 이슈에 휘말릴 가능성에 대비하고 있다는 방증”이라고 했다.고재석 기자 jayko@donga.com▶ 네이버에서 [신동아] 채널 구독하기▶ 신동아 최신호 보기 / 정기구독 신청하기	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=262&aid=0000013303
2020.06.23.	코리아중앙데일리	We Mobility is the latest start-up to take on the carpool fight	Park Hyun, CEO of We Mobility, sat down with the JoongAng Ilbo for an interview on June 18. [PARK MIN-JE]     Carpooling never took off in Korea. Uber tried and failed to launch here, and local companies like Poolus and Tada built up a significant user base only to be pushed out by hostile legislation and lobbying from influential taxi companies. Yet despite the obvious hurdles, carpooling start-up We Mobility has decided to throw its hat into the ring.    We Mobility has applied to try out its carpooling service, We Pool, under a regulatory sandbox program by the Ministry of Science and ICT.         We Pool faces an uphill struggle. Tada Basic, operated by VCNC, was probably the most successful local carpooling or ride-hailing company. Operating more like a ride-hailing service, Tada used 11-seat vans to ferry passengers around. The service accumulated 1.7 million users before it called it a day on April 10, a month after the National Assembly passed the Passenger Transport Service Act, known as the Tada Prohibition Act, which restricts renting vans with drivers to touring purposes only.    "The current Passenger Transport Service Act that was revised last year only allows the use of taxis within a mobility platform. Mobility start-ups that cannot afford to buy or rent cars are on the edge of a cliff," said Park Hyun, CEO of We Mobility.    “Although the government says it will reduce the cost of acquiring taxi licenses for start-ups seeking platform businesses, that does not help much,” Park said. “Since the purpose of the carpool law is to reduce traffic congestion, we need to develop an intermediate server for peer-to-peer (P2P) car-sharing without having to buy or rent cars."    According to Article 81 of the Passenger Transport Service Act, personal vehicles cannot be used for business purposes. But carpooling during commuting hours is an exception and start-ups have previously used this loophole.     That was how Poolus and Luxi, a carpool platform that connects drivers with riders, were able to run their businesses. Luxi was eventually bought by Kakao Mobility. Park, the former chief marketing officer at Luxi, left the company to start We Mobility in 2018.  We Mobility applied for a regulatory sandbox last month to launch its carpool service. [WE MOBILITY]  Exploiting that loophole did not go down well with the powerful taxi unions, who argued that the carpooling services were operating outside of rush hour. When Kakao Mobility attempted to launch a carpooling service in December 2018 based on its acquisition of Luxi, the taxi industry backlash was intense.    To appease the taxi drivers, with whom Kakao Mobility operates a huge part of its business, the company promised that it would only use its carpooling services from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.     Three carpooling start-ups, We Mobility, Poolus and WITS Mobility, issued their own statement attacking Kakao's promise, arguing that those hours don't actually match the real commuting hours for lots of people. Nevertheless, the compromise was reflected in the revision of the Passenger Transport Service Act in August last year. WITS Mobility, which ran the carpooling service Udigo, immediately terminated its service and Poolus later gave up as well.    "The revision does not properly reflect the reality of commuting hours in Korea — it's unrealistically short," said Park. "It is difficult to gather carpool participants in a situation where it may become illegal if they get out of the car at 8:01 a.m., just after the carpool permit time."  We Mobility applied for a regulatory sandbox last month to launch its carpool service. [WE MOBILITY] Realizing that it has become difficult to continue its business, We Mobility tried to find a middle ground. To prevent drivers operating outside commuting hours — which the taxi industry is mostly concerned about — the company created a platform that only works during commuting hours, but with more realistic commuting hours.    "If we add a carpool option to consumers without attacking taxi drivers’ rights, we can solve the commuting traffic problem," said Park. "More than 1 million long-distance commuters are traveling between Seoul and Gyeonggi every day using their cars, and 86 percent of them are driving alone. The goal is to match 1.3 million commuters using public transportation with these drivers to reduce social costs and improve the quality of commuting."         We Mobility has developed a system that only matches carpool users after verifying that they are carpooling for commuting purposes. The trip has to be a long-distance trip of more than 10 kilometers (6 miles), which is longer than the average taxi trip, at 5.4 kilometers, and members can be matched only if their regular commuting routes match for at least 70 percent of the journey.      To eliminate the controversy over paid transportation, the fare is about 3,500 won ($2.90) for 10 kilometers, which is only 50 to 75 percent of the standard taxi cost. In order to make this work, the company has applied for a regulatory sandbox to extend commuting hours to from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. The time allowed for carpooling will be increased from a total of four hours a day to 10 hours. The target areas are Seoul, Gyeonggi, Busan and Ulsan.      "Even if we increase commuting hours, it will be difficult for drivers to turn full-time because the fare is lower than the operating cost," Park said. "As we revised it to comply with the taxi drivers’ demands, I hope we can get a chance to start the carpooling service."     But getting that regulatory sandbox is certainly not guaranteed.    "I applied for a regulatory sandbox, but I'm clutching at straws," Park said. "Since the passage of the revised bill last year March that put restrictions on carpooling hours, our number of employees has decreased from 23 to 13 and the remaining employees are currently working for free. Our goal is to upgrade mobility and fintech industry data with user data obtained from carpooling services."

2020.06.03.	코리아중앙데일리	Over 100 companies express interest in MyData services	The National Assembly on Jan. 9 approves data reform legislation that relaxed restrictions on access and utilization of personal information considered to have held back the development of innovative services and products. [YONHAP]      With two months left before the official launching of MyData, a preliminary government survey has found huge interest not only from major commercial banks, but also the three major telecommunication companies — SK Telecom, KT and LG U+, leading IT companies such as Naver and Kakao and start-ups such as leading fintech company Toss.    MyData is a government-led project that gives businesses access to customer information.    According to the Financial Services Commission on Wednesday, 116 companies have shown interest in getting government approval to launch MyData services in a survey conducted between May 14 and May 28.    Among those that have expressed an interest, the majority are financial companies including banks, insurance companies and credit card issuers, at 47 percent.    Other applicants included 20 fintech companies and 41 non-financial companies.    The FSC in a statement said there were a wide variety of industries, not only finance but also IT, telecommunications and even retail that expressed an interest.      MyData is considered a major goldmine for businesses.      MyData allows customers to manage personal financial information that is spread among different financial institutions, from different bank accounts to insurance and credit card payments as well as stock investment and loan balance under a single app.    According to the FSC statement, customers will be able to access customized services including information management, wealth management and credit management whenever and wherever at a reason price.    It added that MyData will revolutionize local financial services, making them consumer-centric, rather than geared toward companies, by allowing clients to easily compare and choose services and products by preference.    MyData, which has become legally viable thanks to the reform bills that relax rules about handling personal information approved by the National Assembly in January, will officially launch on Aug. 5.      Once approved by the government, even a non-financial company will have access to the vital financial information of customers, which was previously exclusively limited to financial companies.      It will provide essential information such as a person’s spending habits and interest that allows companies to design customized services and products.      Even small players will be able to offer competitive services and products, fueling competition in the industry.    The government in 2018 announced the plan to expand the local data market into a 10 trillion won ($8.2 billion) industry. At the time it was worth 6.3 trillion won.

2020.06.18.	매경닷컴	문 대통령, 한국판 뉴딜 첫 행보로 더존비즈온 전격 방문…데이터 중심 경제혁신 강조	문재인 대통령이 18일 데이터·AI 전문기업인 더존비즈온을 찾아 데이터 중심의 경제 혁신 의지를 강조했다. 데이터 산업 육성은 집권 후반기 국정 비전으로 제시한 '한국판 뉴딜'의 핵심 과제로 꼽힌다. '한국판 뉴딜'과 관련한 문 대통령의 경제 행보는 이번이 첫 번째다.더존비즈온은 회계, 세무, 인사 등 회사의 자원을 관리하는 프로그램인 ERP를 개발하고 서비스하는 B2B(기업 간 거래) 기업이다. 더존비즈온은 코로나19 국면에서 중소기업들을 위해 비대면 서비스 플랫폼을 무상 공급하며 지역 경제 활성화와 상생에 기여했다는 평가를 받는다. 지난해 5월에는 '실시간 회계 빅데이터를 이용한 AI(인공지능) 신용정보 서비스'가 금융위원회의 혁신금융서비스로 지정되기도 했다. 기업들의 회계 정보를 AI기법으로 분석해 해당 기업의 신용 정보를 금융기관에 제공하는 서비스다. 기업은 이를 통해 금융기관으로부터 보다 수월하게 대출을 받을 수 있다. 문 대통령은 현장 방문을 통해 데이터·AI를 통해 새로운 기회와 양질의 미래 일자리를 창출하는 '21세기 디지털 뉴딜'을 민·관이 합심해 신속히 추진해 나가야 한다고 강조했다.더존비즈온은 국내 핀테크(fintech·금융기술) 분야의 선두주자로 매년 20~30% 고성장을 이어가고 있다. 지난해 매출액은 전년 대비 15.8% 증가한 2627억원, 영업이익은 23.7% 증가한 668억원을 기록했다.최근 정부가 한국판 뉴딜의 핵심 사업 중 하나로 디지털 인프라와 비대면 산업 육성 방침을 밝히면서 더존비즈온이 수혜를 입을 것이란 전망이 나온다. 문재인 정부는 오는 2022년까지 디지털 뉴딜에 13조4000억원을 투입해 약 33만개의 일자리를 창출하겠다는 계획이다. 정부는 오는 7월 디지털 뉴딜을 포함한 '한국판 뉴딜 종합계획'을 발표할 예정이다.한편 리딩투자증권은 이날 더존비즈온에 대해 구사업 안정성과 신사업 성장성을 확인했다고 평가했다. 투자의견은 '매수', 목표주가는 11만1000원에서 13만3000원으로 올렸다.오승택 리딩투자증권 연구원은 "오는 2분기 매출액은 전년 동기 대비 16.9% 늘어난 매출액 726억원, 영업이익은 20.0% 증가한 183억원을 전망한다"며 "ERP(전사적자원관리) 부문은 9.7% 성장한 384억원이 전망되는데, 이는 작년 현대백화점, 동서발전 등을 기반으로 한 'D_ERP'(차세대 ERP)의 신규 수주 호조가 이어지고 있기 때문"이라고 설명했다.

2020.05.26.	신동아	간편결제 규제 사라지면 신용카드 망한다	“간편결제 지급 수단 중 하나로 전락할 것” ● “43개 업체 50개 서비스…하루 602만 건 거래”● 전년 대비 일평균 건수 56.6%, 금액 44.0% 늘어 ● 현재 간편결제 80% 이상이 신용카드 연계● 규제 완화하면 카드사 제휴 필요 없어져● “전문 지급 결제 회사로 진화 모색해야”네이버페이, 카카오페이, 스마일페이, 쿠페이. 그야말로 페이 전성시대다. ‘ㅇㅇ페이’란 간편결제 서비스를 의미하는 것으로 ‘네이버페이’처럼 해당 서비스를 제공하는 업체 브랜드명을 수식어처럼 붙이는 경우가 많다. 휴대전화 등 전자 장치에 결제 정보를 미리 등록한 뒤 정해진 곳에서 간단한 인증만으로 결제를 진행하는 방식을 지칭한다. 휴대전화 사용이 보편화한 데다가 온라인 쇼핑 이용자가 급증하면서 간편결제 서비스 역시 일상생활로 자리 잡고 있다. 네이버·카카오 등 인터넷 포털업체뿐 아니라 G마켓과 옥션을 운영하는 이베이코리아, 쿠팡 등 유통업체까지 가세하면서 페이 시장의 경쟁은 점차 치열해지고 있다. 가장 활성화한 간편결제 서비스로 평가받는 네이버페이와 카카오페이의 누적 가입자는 각각 3000만 명에 달한다. 이베이코리아의 스마일페이나 쿠팡의 쿠페이는 1400만~1500만 명가량이다.일평균 602만 건, 전년 대비 56.6% 늘어간편결제는 5~6년 전까지만 해도 소비자에게 생소한 용어였다. 그러다 2014년 이후 카카오페이와 네이버페이, 이베이코리아의 스마일페이 등이 줄줄이 출시되면서 주목받기 시작했다. 박태준 여신금융연구소 실장은 최근 보고서를 통해 “간편결제 시장은 2016년 이후 급성장했다. 2018년 기준으로 총 43개 사가 50종의 간편결제 서비스를 제공하고 있다”고 설명했다. 한국은행에 따르면 지난해 카드 기반 간편결제 서비스 일평균 이용 실적은 602만 건, 1745억 원으로 전년보다 각각 56.6%, 44.0% 늘었다. 간편결제 서비스에 가장 적극적이었던 곳은 포털 업체들이었다. 네이버와 카카오는 일찍부터 대규모 회원을 기반으로 금융시장에 발을 들여놓으려 했다. 카카오는 지난 2014년 간편결제 서비스를 도입했다. 이후 결제와 송금 등 다양한 분야로 서비스를 확대하고 있다. 2017년에는 핀테크 사업부를 카카오페이로 분사하면서 사업을 본격화했다. 이후 편의점 등에 결제 시스템을 도입하는 등 오프라인으로도 영역을 넓히고 있다. 2015년 간편결제 서비스를 시작한 네이버는 지난해 7월 네이버페이를 ‘네이버파이낸셜’로 분사하며 금융 사업을 본격화했다. 네이버파이낸셜은 사용자가 네이버페이를 이용하다 쌓은 페이포인트를 활용하는 방안 등을 추진하고 있다. 결제를 한 뒤 받은 포인트를 예·적금 등 투자 상품에 넣을 수 있도록 하는 식이다. 간편결제를 기반으로 금융 서비스를 확대할 경우 포털 자체의 영향력이 높아질 뿐만 아니라 소비자의 충성도가 더욱 높아질 가능성이 있다. 통상 소비자는 한곳에서 다양한 서비스를 이용하는 것을 선호하는 경향이 있기 때문이다. 한 사이트에서 쇼핑도 하고, 송금도 하고, 검색도 하면서 머무는 식이다. 포털업체뿐 아니라 온라인 유통업체들이 간편결제 서비스에 적극 뛰어드는 것도 이런 이유에서다. 온라인 유통업계에서는 소비자를 자사 사이트에 머물도록 하는 게 가장 중요한 전략으로 꼽힌다. 쿠팡은 최근 사내 간편결제 서비스 운영 조직을 분사해 핀테크 자회사인 ‘쿠팡페이’를 설립한다고 밝혔다. 쿠팡은 자회사를 통해 기존 결제 사업 외에 다양한 핀테크 서비스 개발을 추진한다는 계획이다. 쿠팡은 2016년 로켓페이라는 간편결제 서비스를 선보였고, 지난해 5월 명칭을 쿠페이로 변경했다. 쿠팡에 따르면 쿠페이의 사용자 수는 1500만 명 수준이다. 거래액은 지난 2018년 기준으로 이베이코리아의 스마일페이, 네이버의 네이버페이에 이어 국내 3위를 기록했다. 오린아 이베스트투자증권 연구원은 “쿠팡페이는 온라인 사이트와 오프라인 결제를 아우르는 간편결제 플랫폼으로 사업을 확장할 것으로 예상된다”면서 “이커머스 분야 록인(Lock-in·잠금) 효과를 강화하면서 포트폴리오 다각화도 본격화할 것”이라고 분석했다.후불·할부 결제는 신용카드사만카카오페이 가맹점인 서울 서대문구 충정로 ‘청안식탁’.  [지호영 기자]이베이코리아 ‘스마일페이’의 경우 가입자 수는 1500만 명가량으로 알려졌다. 이베이코리아는 온·오프라인 업체들과 지속적인 제휴 확대를 통해 활용도를 높여왔다. 스마일페이는 2014년 서비스 초반까지만 해도 G마켓과 옥션의 전용 간편결제 서비스였지만 2016년부터 던킨도너츠, 파리바게뜨 등 SPC 그룹을 비롯해 신라 인터넷면세점, 마켓컬리, CJ CGV 등 영역을 넓히고 있다. 반면 쿠페이는 아직 쿠팡과 쿠팡이츠 등 자체 서비스에서만 사용할 수 있다. 확장성이 향후 과제인 셈이다. 롯데·신세계 등 오프라인 위주 대형 유통업체들도 온라인 사업을 강화하면서 페이 서비스에 공을 들이고 있다. 롯데의 경우 엘포인트 회원이 3950만 명에 달하는데 이들을 간편결제 서비스인 엘페이로 유도하는 방안을 고민하고 있다. SSG페이를 운영하는 신세계 역시 2000만 명의 회원을 보유한 신세계포인트와 연계할 경우 큰 시너지를 낼 수 있을 것으로 기대하고 있다. 이에 반해 그간 결제수단의 대부분을 차지한 실물 플라스틱 카드는 점차 존재감을 잃어가고 있다. 현금 위주 시장에서 플라스틱 신용카드 시장으로 전환한 뒤 다시 빠르게 간편결제 시장으로 무게중심이 이동하는 형국이다. 그렇다면 신용카드사들은 당장 먹고살 길이 막막해지는 것일까. 꼭 그렇지는 않다. 아직까지는 이런 변화가 신용카드사에 직접적인 타격을 주고 있지는 않다. 간편결제 서비스에는 미리 현금을 충전해 두었다가 결제하거나, 은행 계좌를 연동해 두고 돈이 빠져나가게 하는 식의 ‘직불결제’ 기능도 있다. 다만 아직까지는 신용카드와 연계된 결제가 대부분을 차지한다. 예를 들어 카카오페이에 국민카드 정보를 입력한 뒤 사용하는 식이다. 카드업계에 따르면 국내에서 발생하는 간편결제의 80% 이상이 신용카드와 연계된 결제다. 한 카드업계 관계자는 “신용카드처럼 일단 물건을 사고 일정 기간 뒤에 돈을 갚아나가는 ‘후불 결제식’ 소비 패턴을 바꾸기는 쉽지 않을 것”이라면서 “장기적으로는 변화가 있을지 몰라도 단기적으로는 오히려 카드사에도 득이 되는 분위기”라고 설명했다. 특히 많은 소비자가 활용하는 할부 결제 방식은 신용카드만 보유한 기능인 탓에 간편결제 서비스 업체 입장에서는 카드사들과 제휴가 꼭 필요하다.‘적과의 동침’, 규제 완화하면 위기카드사와 간편결제 업체 간 제휴도 활발하게 이뤄지고 있다. 제휴를 통해 만든 신용카드를 ‘상업자 표시 신용카드(PLCC)’라고 한다. 카드 겉면에는 ‘OO페이’라는 간편결제 서비스 브랜드가 그려져 있지만, 사실 기존 신용카드사가 내놓은 카드라고 볼 수 있다. 해당 사이트에서 사용할 경우 포인트 등 혜택을 더 주는 방식으로 운영된다. 일각에서는 이를 두고 신용카드사가 ‘적과의 동침’을 하고 있다고 지적한다. 카드사 입장에서나 간편결제 사업자 입장에서나 회원을 늘릴 수 있다는 점에서 아직은 서로 간 제휴가 ‘윈-윈’이다. 카드사들을 회원으로 두고 있는 여신금융협회 산하 여신금융연구소는 간편결제 사업자들과 제휴를 늘릴 필요가 있다고 조언한 바 있다. 박태준 여신금융연구소 실장은 “온라인 시장점유율 측면에서 간편결제 서비스 업자는 카드사를 압도하고 있다”면서 “오프라인 시장의 경우 주도권을 유지해야 하지만, 온라인 시장에서는 제휴 확대로 신용카드 비중을 높이는 노력이 필요하다”라고 했다. 다만 이런 흐름이 지속되면 신용카드사들도 위기에 봉착할 가능성이 있다. 당장은 여러 금융 규제로 인해 간편결제 업체들이 스스로 할 수 있는 게 많지 않아 신용카드사들을 필요로 하지만, 상황이 달라질 수 있기 때문이다. 점차 간편결제 사업자에 힘을 실어주는 규제 완화가 이뤄질 가능성이 크다는 점에서 그렇다. 간편결제 서비스가 ‘핀테크(Fintech)’ 혁신을 위해 허용해 준 사업이라는 점에도 주목할 필요가 있다. 핀테크란 금융(Finance)에 기술(Technology)을 입혀 산업을 역동적으로 진화시키겠다는 의지가 담긴 용어다. 이를 위해서는 전통적 금융 규제에서 벗어나 핀테크 기술이 발전할 수 있도록 새로운 제도를 만들어줘야 한다. 이와 관련해 최근 금융 당국은 간편결제 시장에 파장을 일으킬 수 있는 제도의 추진을 검토하겠다고 밝힌 바 있다. 바로 지급지시서비스업(PISP)이다. 특정 사이트나 애플리케이션에 로그인하면 소비자가 보유한 모든 은행 계좌를 통해 결제와 송금을 할 수 있도록 하는 서비스다. 간편결제 업체들이 PISP 사업자가 되면 금융업계에 미치는 영향이 클 전망이다. 제도가 시행되면 소비자는 신용·체크카드를 특정 간편결제 서비스에 따로 등록하지 않아도 인터넷 쇼핑을 편리하게 이용할 수 있게 된다. 가령 네이버에서 쇼핑을 한 뒤 본인의 신한은행 계좌 잔액으로 결제하도록 하면 된다. 이 과정에서 은행이나 카드사는 관여할 수 있는 게 없다. 간편결제 업체는 일일이 은행이나 신용카드사와 제휴를 맺기보다 PISP를 확대하려고 할 가능성이 커진다. 금융사의 힘을 빌리지 않는 게 여러 면에서 낫기 때문이다. 한 간편결제 업체 관계자는 “PISP가 시행되면 신용카드 기반의 결제 서비스보다는 기존 금융사와 제휴하지 않아도 되는 직불결제 서비스를 확대하는 데 공을 들이게 될 것”이라고 말했다.“카드사 주도권 약화할 수밖에”간편결제 업체들에 소액에 한해 후불결제를 허용하는 방안도 꾸준히 검토되고 있다. 후불결제란 결제 후 일정 기간이 지난 뒤 대금을 내도록 하는 것으로 사실상 신용카드와 같은 기능이다. 단, 소액에 한정해 허용해 주는 방식이다. 리스크 관리 어려움 탓에 당장 실현 가능성이 없다는 의견도 있지만 결국 언젠가 이뤄질 수밖에 없다는 게 업계 안팎의 시각이다. 이에 신용카드사들이 당장 간편결제 업체들과 제휴에만 만족하지 말고 근본적인 대응 방안을 마련해야 한다는 지적이 나온다. 한 카드업계 관계자는 “신용카드 결제가 아직까지 대세이긴 하지만 점차 간편결제 서비스에 포함된 여러 지급 수단 중 하나로 위상이 떨어질 가능성이 있다”면서 “미래 고객인 젊은 층은 이런 방식을 더욱 자연스럽게 받아들일 것”이라고 말했다. 그러면서 “이럴 경우 카드사의 주도권은 약화할 수밖에 없다”라고 설명했다. 박태준 실장은 “다양한 고객 맞춤식 상품과 서비스가 등장해 금융업권과 핀테크 업체 간 경쟁이 치열해질 전망”이라면서 “카드사는 지급수단을 결정하는 주체가 고객이라는 점을 인지해 기존 고객 이탈 방지와 새로운 고객 유인을 위해 노력할 필요가 있다”고 강조했다. 그러면서 “전통적 카드 비즈니스 외에도 전문화된 지급 결제 회사로의 진화를 모색해 시장 환경 변화에 대비할 필요가 있다”고 덧붙였다.나원식 비즈니스워치 기자 setisoul@bizwatch.co.kr▶ 네이버에서 [신동아] 채널 구독하기▶ 신동아 최신호 보기 / 정기구독 신청하기	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=262&aid=0000013267
2020.03.19.	코리아헤럴드	[Exclusive] Foreign residents still locked out of online banks	Despite FSC’s recent guidelines, major operators bar them(Yonhap)Despite the growing demand for “untact banking” amid fears of the fast-spreading novel coronavirus, foreigners in South Korea cannot subscribe to online banking services, due to the prolonged verification process.Untact banking refers to online or mobile banking services without physical contact between bank staff and customers. Late last year, the Financial Services Commission set new guidelines to allow foreigners’ identification card as a legal document for approval. Although they went into effect on Jan. 1, authorities still have not decided on building an online authentication system to check IDs for banking transactions, officials told The Korea Herald. “The FSC has been working on building a system in coordination with the Ministry of Justice and other institutions after the announcement, but it has not been decided when it can be implemented,” said a FSC official.A Korean citizen needs a resident registration card, or a driver’s license, to open a bank account online. A copy of the ID is then sent to related government ministries online to check its authenticity.Foreigner’s alien registration identification card, issued by the immigration office under the Justice Ministry, however, is not approved to open an online bank account, though it should be possible according to the guidelines. “I tried to open a savings account on Kakao Bank with my identification card, but the bank’s mobile app didn’t approve,” said Amanda Field, 27, a foreign resident from Canada. “I also tried K Bbnk, but ended up getting a message saying a foreigner cannot open an account,” Online-only banks in Korea, Kakao Bank and K bank are aware of growing foreigners’ demand for their services, but they are blaming authorities.“We can’t operate banking services for foreigners since the computerized system for checking foreign residents’ identification card is yet to be implemented by the FSC and other related ministries,” said a spokesperson at Kakao Bank. Kakao Bank, an online-only banking unit under Korea’s largest mobile messenger Kakao, is reviewing processes like adopting automatic translation before starting untact banking services for foreigners. But in the absence of the identification system it cannot rollout the service, he added.It has been five years both Kakao Bank and K bank launched services, under South Korea’s ambitious drive to nurture the fintech market.It has been five years both Kakao Bank and K bank launched services, under South Korea’s ambitious drive to nurture the fintech market.

2020.01.16.	디지털데일리	센스톤, 한국 스타트업 최초 액센츄어 ‘핀테크 이노베이션 랩’ 합류	센스톤 오수현COO(좌)_유창훈 대표이사(우)[디지털데일리 이상일기자] 센스톤(대표이사 유창훈)이 한국 스타트업 최초로 글로벌 기업인 액센츄어(Accenture)의 ‘핀테크 이노베이션 랩(Fintech Innovation Lab)’에 합류했다고 16일 밝혔다.  ‘Fintech Innovation Lab’은 글로벌 기업인 액센츄어(Accenture)가 뉴욕, 런던, 홍콩에서 글로벌 핀테크 스타트업과 주요 금융기관을 한곳에 모아 운영하는 멘토쉽 프로그램이다. 이 프로그램은 2010년 런던에서 시작해 유럽과 아시아로 확대되어, 초기 성장 단계의 스타트업이 세계 최고의 금융 서비스 기업의 지원을 통해 비즈니스 모델을 수정하고, 실제 테스트로 이어갈 기회까지 제공한다. 선발 과정에서 통상 300개 이상의 기업들이 지원하고 이중 20개 기업을 선발하여 12주간 운영하는데, 특히 액센츄어(Accenture) 고객사들의 의견이 많이 반영되어 선정된다. 특히 센스톤은 아시아 지역이 아닌 유럽 지역의 글로벌 경쟁을 통해 합류해 국내 업체들간의 경쟁이 아니라 글로벌 스타트업과의 경쟁을 통해 선발됐다는 것에 의미를 부여하고 있다. 유창훈 대표에 따르면, 선정 과정의 발표 때부터 가장 많은 관심을 받았고, 프로그램이 시작되기 전부터 영국의 은행으로부터 미팅 요청을 받았다는 설명이다. 유 대표는 "센스톤은 이미 영국 런던에 스위치(swIDch)라는 이름으로 글로벌 비즈니스 헤드쿼터를 설립했고, 현지 상주 인력을 구성하고 영국 정부 및 금융기관의 프로그램을 통해 현지화가 진행되었고, 글로벌 실적까지 가지고 있기 때문에, 유럽 시장을 대상으로 하는 프로그램임에도 최종 합류가 가능했다"고 밝혔다. 올해 1월 6일부터 프로그램이 시작돼, 현재 2주간의 오리엔테이션이 진행 중인데, 이 기간에 집중적으로 여러 멘토와의 일대일 미팅과 스피드 릴레이 미팅이 이어지며, 이를 통해 남은 10주간의 방향을 잡게 된다. 유창훈 대표는 “현재 진행 중인 오리엔테이션에서도 20개 스타트업 중 센스톤의 기술과 비즈니스 모델이 가장 클리어하다는 평을 받고 있다.”라며, 본 프로그램에서 비즈니스적인 실적이 확보 될 수 있을 것을 기대하고 있다. 이뿐만 아니라, 센스톤은 홍콩에서 1월 13일부터 이틀간 진행된 ‘아시안 파이낸셜 포럼(Asian Financial Forum 2020)’에도 한국 핀테크 스타트업 대표로 초대되어 부스 운영과 발표를 했다. 이 행사는 아시아 각 국가에서 대표 스타트업을 한 곳씩 선발하여 행사를 진행하는데, 각 국가의 여러 핀테크 육성 프로그램으로부터 여러 기업들을 추천받은 후 홍콩 행사 기관에서 직접 대상 기업을 선정한다.  <이상일 기자>2401@ddaily.co.kr뉴스채널 설정 - 네이버 메인에서 디지털데일리 뉴스를 볼 수 있어요.IT정보의 즐거운 업그레이드[딜라이트닷넷]<저작권자 © 디지털데일리 무단전재-재배포금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=105&oid=138&aid=0002081686

KB국민카드 이동철 사장에게는 부임 이후 캄보디아, 인도네시아에 이어 3번째 해외 금융회사 인수가 됐다. 이 사장은 올 초 신년사에서 언급한 동남아시아 국가를 중심으로 한 해외 사업의 지속 확장을 강조한 바 있으며, 글로벌 전략에 한 층 가속도가 붙을 것으로 기대하고 있다.     이번 진출은 1998년 국제통화기금(IMF) 사태 이후 국내 은행과 여신전문금융회사가 신규 인허가 또는 인수합병 등을 통해 태국에 진출한 최초의 사례로 향후 KB국민은행 등 KB금융그룹 주요 계열사들의 태국 시장 진출에도 교두보 역할을 수행할 것으로 기대된다.    KB국민카드는 한국과 태국 금융 당국의 승인 절차와 인수 계약을 마무리하는 ‘딜 클로징(Deal Closing)’등을 거쳐 이르면 연말께 공식 자회사로 편입할 계획이다.    태국 소비자 금융 시장은 2018년 기준 약 410조원 규모로 추산되며 최근 5년 평균 8%에 이르는 안정적인 성장세를 이어가고 있다. 또 동남아시아 최고 수준의 신용 인프라를 구축하고 있고 정부의 ‘캐시리스’ 정책에 힘입어 신용카드 시장도 연 평균 7% 이상 성장하는 등 신용카드를 비롯해 각종 신용 사업이 용이한 것으로 평가 받고 있다.

KB국민카드 관계자는 “이번 태국 시장 진출은 신용카드 등 금융 비즈니스 환경과 수요 그리고 현지 소비자 금융 시장의 지속적인 성장세 등을 종합적으로 고려해 장기적인 성장 가능성이 높고 전속 시장을 활용한 시너지 효과 창출이 가능한 현지 금융회사 인수를 위한 2년 여의 준비 작업이 결실을 맺게 된 것”이라며 “캄보디아, 라오스 등 인도차이나 반도 국가에 진출해 거둔 성공 경험을 바탕으로 이번에 인수한 회사를 10년 내 태국 최상위 소비자 금융회사로 도약시키는 등 동남아시아 주요 국가에서도 KB국민카드만의 해외 진출 성공 스토리를 계속해서 이어갈 것”이라고 말했다.    권지예 기자 kwon.jiye@joongang.co.kr  ▶ [오늘의 운세 바로가기] [만화 바로가기]▶ [일간스포츠 바로가기]     ⓒ일간스포츠(https://isplus.joins.com) 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=241&aid=0003019021

2020.04.27.	eTimesinternet Co	KB국민카드, 태국 소비자 금융 시장 진출...카드업계 최초	27일 서울 종로구 KB국민카드 본사에서 온라인 영상 계약 방식으로 진행된 태국 여신전문금융회사 제이 핀테크 지분 인수 계약식 후 이동철 KB국민카드 사장(왼쪽)이 아디삭 수쿰비타야 제이마트 그룹 회장과 협약서를 들어 보이고 있다.KB국민카드가 태국 소비자 금융 시장에 진출한다. 국내 여신전문금융회사 최초다.KB국민카드는 27일 신용·자동차대출 등 소비자 금융 사업을 영위하는 태국 여신전문금융회사 '제이 핀테크(J Fintech)' 지분 인수를 위한 신주인수계약(SSA)을 체결했다고 밝혔다.총 인수 대금은 248억원(6억5000만바트)이며 KB국민카드는 제이 핀테크 의결권 지분 50.99%를 보유하게 된다.제이 핀테크는 태국 내 휴대폰 유통과 채권 추심 1위 업체를 계열사로 보유한 제이마트 그룹 금융 자회사다. 이 회사는 앞으로 신용·자동차대출 등 대출 사업과 신용카드 사업을 영위할 수 있다.KB국민카드는 한국과 태국 금융 당국의 승인 절차와 인수 계약을 마무리하는 '딜 클로징' 등을 거쳐 이르면 연말께 공식 자회사로 편입할 계획이다.KB국민카드의 태국 진출은 1998년 국제통화기금(IMF) 사태 이후 국내 금융사 최초 사례라는 점에서 눈길을 끈다. KB국민카드는 향후 KB국민은행 등 그룹 주요 계열사들의 태국 시장 진출에도 교두보 역할을 수행할 것으로 보인다.KB국민카드는 현지 고객에 최적화된 신용 대출 신상품과 다양한 디지털 기반 상품을 선보이고 중장기적으로 신용카드 시장 진출을 도모할 계획이다.KB국민카드 관계자는 “이번 태국 시장 진출은 2년여 준비 작업이 결실을 맺게 된 것”이라면서 “캄보디아, 라오스 등에서 거둔 성공 경험을 바탕으로 10년 내 태국 최상위 소비자 금융회사로 도약해 해외 진출 성공 스토리를 이어갈 것”이라고 말했다.박윤호기자 yuno@etnews.com▶ 네이버 홈에서 [전자신문] 구독하기▶ 전자신문 바로가기 [Copyright ⓒ 전자신문 & 전자신문인터넷, 무단전재 및 재배포 금지]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=030&aid=0002880181

2020.06.12.	스포츠조선	탄탄대로 달리던 토스, '부정결제' 이슈로 사업 확장 '급제동'?	1700만 고객을 확보하며 승승장구하던 금융서비스 업체 토스(toss)가 '부정결제 사고' 논란에 휩싸였다.보안에 대한 불안감으로 토스를 탈퇴하거나 계좌 연결을 끊는 가입자들이 늘어나면서, 제3인터넷전문은행 출범과 증권·보험 서비스 영역 확대를 눈앞에 둔 토스에 '악재'가 됐다는 지적이다. 또한 금융당국의 간편결제 전면 점검 선언으로 관련 업계에서도 '불똥이 튈까' 우려하는 상황이다. 지난 2015년 2월 간편 송금서비스로 업계에 첫 선을 보인 토스는, 서비스 3년여만인 2018년 11월 가입자 1000만명을 돌파하며 대표적 핀테크(fintech) 업체로 자리 잡았다. 2020년 현재 누적 가입자는 1700만명 선이고, 기업 가치는 3조원에 육박하는 것으로 평가되고 있다. ▶비중 1% 웹결제 사고라지만…가입자 줄줄이 탈퇴 '위기'토스와 관련업계에 따르면, 지난 3일 블리자드 등 온라인 가맹점 3곳에서 총 8명의 고객 명의로 총 938만원의 부정 결제가 발생했다.토스는 피해 신고 접수 직후 문제가 발생한 사용자의 계정을 차단했고, 의심되는 IP로 접속한 계정도 미리 탐지해 확산을 막았다고 밝혔다. 고객 4명으로부터 민원 접수 후 가맹점 결제 내역을 전수 조사해 또다른 피해 고객 4명에게 해당 사실을 알렸다는 것. 피해 금액은 모두 환급 조치했다. 당초 해킹 가능성이 거론됐지만, 미리 입수한 사용자의 인적사항과 비밀번호를 활용한 것으로 토스를 통한 유출이 아니라는 것이 토스의 입장이다. 비밀번호의 경우 토스 서버에 저장되지 않기 때문에 유출이 불가능하고, 피해 고객 8명 중 2명이 이미 다른 결제 서비스에서도 피해를 본 경험이 있다는 것도 이를 뒷받침한다는 주장이다.그러나 이번 결제 사고 예방과 대응에 문제가 있었다는 지적이 이어지고 있다.우선 확인 절차가 상대적으로 단순한 웹결제에서 이번 사고가 발생한 만큼, 선제적인 보완이 필요했다는 의견이 나온다. 스마트폰으로 본인 확인 절차를 한 번 더 거치는 앱결제와 달리, 웹결제는 사용자의 이름·생년월일·전화번호 등 개인정보와 비밀번호 5자리를 입력하면 결제가 가능하다. 토스 관계자는 "이번에 문제가 된 웹결제 비중은 결제금액 기준 1% 수준이고, 가맹점 수로는 5%(20곳) 정도"라면서 "이번 사고 이후 앱결제 방식으로 전환이 진행 중이다"고 밝혔다.또한 토스의 이상 거래 감지 시스템(Fraud Detection System)이 제대로 작동했는 지에 대한 의혹도 제기됐다. 토스 측에서 "일부 도용 시도 건에 대해서는 이상 거래 감지 시스템을 통해 차단했다"고 설명했지만, 짧은 시간 안에 같은 금액 결제가 수차례 된 상황을 잡아내지 못했다는 지적이다. 여기에 해당 사고에 대해 즉시 금융감독원 신고와 고객 공지를 하지 않았다는 비판도 이어졌다. 토스에서는 "해킹이 아니라서 공지 사항이라고 판단하지 않았다"는 해명을 내놨지만, 이를 보는 시선은 곱지 않다.  더구나 부정결제 사건이 알려진 직후, "지난 2월 토스 생체 인증을 악용한 보이스피싱을 당했다"는 주장까지 제기되며 논란에 불을 지폈다.이에 대해 토스 측에서는 "피해자 개인정보를 확보한 보이스피싱 가해자가 검찰을 사칭하며 보낸 화면에 얼굴이 인식돼 일어난 사건으로, 수사기관에 관련 자료를 제출하는 등 협조하고 있다"고 밝혔다. 토스의 운영사인 비바리퍼블리카는 부정 결제 사고가 알려지자, "고객분들께 심려를 끼치게 되어 매우 안타까운 마음"이라며, "도용된 정보로도 결제가 불가능 하도록 시스템을 고도화하겠다"는 입장을 발표하고 진화에 나섰다. 그러나 온라인 커뮤니티를 중심으로 '탈퇴 인증' 릴레이가 이어지는 등 이용자들의 이탈을 막기에는 역부족인 상황이다. 업계 관계자는 "보안은 디지털 기반 금융업체의 기본인데, 이번 사고로 가입자들의 불신이 확산되는 모양새"라면서, "토스가 그동안 보안에 대한 자신감을 전면에 내세웠던 만큼, 고객들의 실망이 더 큰 것 같다"고 지적했다. 또한 "이번 사고로 인해 당분간 가입자 이탈은 불가피할 것"이라고 전망했다.▶ 대대적 영역 확대 앞두고 '악재'…금융당국 일제 점검에 업계 긴장도업계에서는 서비스 출시 5년여만에 전국민의 3분의 1을 가입자로 확보한 토스가, 이번 사고로 신사업 진출에 영향을 받지 않을까 우려하고 있다. 토스는 전방위적 사업 영역 확대에 나선 상황이다. 내년 인터넷전문은행 공식 출범을 준비 중이고, 하반기에는 증권사 설립 및 보험 서비스 출시를 준비 중이다. 지난 4월에는 2015년 서비스 출시 이후 처음으로 월간 흑자를 기록하는 등 수익성 개선에도 성공했다. 그러나 이러한 분위기에 이번 사고가 치명적 '악재'로 작용할 수 있다는 분석이다. 고객 신뢰도 회복을 위해서는 상당 기간이 소요될 것이고, 새로운 서비스 가입자 유치에도 부정적인 영향을 줄 수 있다는 것이다. 또한 이번 사고에 대한 금융감독원과 경찰의 조사 결과에도 이목이 집중되고 있다.일각에서는 "터질 게 터졌다"는 반응도 나오고 있다. 간편한 서비스를 위해 복잡한 인증 절차를 단순화하면서 예상됐던 위험 요소였다는 지적이다. 이 때문에 급성장한 간편결제 시장 전반에 대한 우려도 나오고 있다.더욱이 10일 금융당국이 간편결제 등 비대면금융 서비스 보안에 대한 일제 점검을 발표하면서, 관련 업계에는 '비상등'이 켜졌다.온라인 간편결제 서비스로 분류되는 토스, 카카오페이, 네이버페이 등은 금융법상 전자금융업자로 금융감독 당국의 감독·검사 영역에 있지만, 은행이나 카드 등 기존 금융사에 비해서는 감시가 소홀하다는 지적을 받아왔다. 토스 역시 2015년 전자금융업자 등록 이후 금감원 검사를 받은 적이 없다. 당국에서는 이번에 토스에서 발생한 부정결제와 비슷한 사고가 재발하지 않도록 간편결제 금융시스템 전반의 허점을 찾겠다는 취지를 밝혔다. 또한 전자금융거래법 개정안에 보안 관련 사항을 보완한다는 방침이다.금융업계 관계자는 "간편결제는 핀테크 업체 뿐 아니라, 기존 금융사들은 물론 유통업체들도 속속 도입하고 있는 대세 서비스"라면서, "이번 사고로 인한 시장 위축이 우려된다"고 밝혔다. 또한 "등돌린 이용자들을 설득하기 위해서는 사후 대처보다는 선제적 시스템 정비와 제도적 보완이 필요하다"고 덧붙였다.김소형기자 compact@sportschosun.com▶무료로 보는 오늘의 운세▶한화 무더기 2군행...김태균은 빠진 이유 [크보핵인싸]- Copyrightsⓒ 스포츠조선(http://sports.chosun.com/), 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=076&aid=0003582983

KB카드는 태국 금융 당국의 승인 등이 마무리되는 연말께 공식 자회사로 편입할 계획이다.태국 소비자 금융 시장은 2018년 기준 약 410조원 규모로 추산되며 최근 5년 평균 8%에 이르는 성장세를 이어가고 있다. 동남아시아 최고 수준의 신용 인프라를 구축하고 있고 정부의 ‘캐시리스(Cashless·무현금)’ 정책에 힘입어 신용카드 시장도 연 평균 7% 이상 성장하고 있다.KB카드는 자회사 편입 후 본사의 지급 보증 등을 통한 자금 조달로 차입 비용 절감을 도모하고 기존 보유 자산의 건전성을 높이는 등 우량 자산 중심의 포트폴리오 재편 작업을 진행할 계획이다.영업 인프라 강화와 영업 채널 다각화를 위해 제이마트 그룹의 자회사인 ‘제이마트 모바일’이 보유한 전국 192개 매장을 전속시장으로 활용, 전국 주요 거점 지역을 중심으로 영업소도 지속적으로 확대해 나갈 예정이다.gil@heraldcorp.com▶우리동네 젠트리피케이션 위험도는?▶코로나19 현황보기 ▶전국 농수축산물 소비 캠페인 - Copyrights ⓒ 헤럴드경제 & heraldbiz.com, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지 -	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=016&aid=0001666756

2020.05.30.	블로터	'금융업이 뒤집힌다'…국내 핀테크 시장 트렌드 TOP3	핀테크(Fintech)의 등장은 금융업에 새바람을 불어넣고 있다. 새로운 사업분야가 창출되고 소비자 접근성은 그 어느 때보다 높아졌다. 기존 금융기업과 기술기업 사이 경계가 흐려지며 무한경쟁 속 혁신 서비스 등장이 예견돼 있기도 하다. 여기에 최근 금융관련 규제가 대폭 완화되며 업계 전반의 변화도 가속될 전망이다. 향후 국내 핀테크 시장의 전망은 어떨까?금융위원회와 한국핀테크지원센터가 개최한 ‘코리아 핀테크위크 2020’이 지난 28일부터 온라인상에서 열렸다. 특별세션 중 '한국의 핀테크 산업 및 정책동향'을  주제로 김세호 삼정 KPMG 상무가 발표한 '국내 핀테크 시장의 주요 트렌드'를 정리해봤다.① 데이터 3법 통과 – 데이터 경제 시대의 개막올해 1월, 개인정보와 산업융합의 접점을 확대한 데이터 3법이 국회를 통과했다. 일각에서는 개인정보 오남용에 대해 우려하고 있지만, 업계의 반응은 고무적이다. 특히 금융업계에서는 기존 금융 서비스 외에도 △유통 △통신 △의료 등 비금융 분야로까지 데이터 경제가 확대될 수 있는 발판이 마련된 것으로 평가하고 있다.이를 통해 고객 중심 데이터 비즈니스가 확대될 것으로 예상된다. 데이터 3법 통과를 계기로 개인정보의 자기결정권이 폭넓게 보장되는 마이데이터(MyData) 가입자는 보다 손쉽게 개인화된 맞춤 서비스를 제공받게 될 것이란 전망이다.마이데이터 사업자들은 개인으로부터 개별 단위의 개인정보 수집·사용 동의를 받아 다양한 개인화 서비스에 접목되도록 중개할 수 있다. 데이터 분석 기반의 고객 맞춤형 보험 상품을 제공하는 인슈어테크 확산, 다양한 거래 이력을 기반으로 한 종합 자산관리 서비스 등의 출현을 예로 들 수 있다.Me2B 개념도 / 자료=삼정KPMG② 오픈뱅킹 시행 – 혁신 서비스 등장의 가속지난해 말부터 국내에 도입된 오픈뱅킹은 핀테크 시대 금융혁신을 위한 핵심 인프라 중 하나다. 오픈뱅킹은 핀테크 사업자와 은행이 별도의 제휴 없이 다양한 서비스를 개발할 수 있도록 핵심금융서비스를 API 형태로 제공하는 시스템이다.과거엔 어려웠던 앱 하나로 모든 은행의 계좌를 조회, 입금, 출금하는 서비스도 오픈뱅킹 아래선 가능하다. 은행은 기존 고객뿐 아니라 전 국민 대상의 서비스 기회가 열린다. 높은 기술·경제적 장벽을 넘어 소비자 요구에 부합하는 최적화 서비스 개발이 가능해진다는 점에서 오픈뱅킹 도입은 소비자와 기업 모두에게 유리한 구조다.국내 오픈뱅킹은 모든 핀테크 기업과 은행이 참여할 수 있다는 점에서 해외 오픈뱅킹보다 더욱 개방적인 시스템이다. 실제 성장 속도도 빠르다. 작년 10월~12월 오픈뱅킹 시범운영 기간과 비교해 전면시행 된 직후인 올해 1월까지 가입자는 3.7배(1197만명) 증가했다. 등록계좌는 2222만 계좌로 2.8배 증가했다. 일평균 이용 건수도 374만건으로 2배 증가했다. 또 짧은 기간 내에 이런 급속한 성장이 이뤄졌다는 것은 그만큼 우리 국민들이 편리하고 혁신적인 금융 서비스를 늘 갈망해왔다는 점을 시사하기도 한다.오픈뱅킹 서비스 개념도 /자료=삼정KPMG③ 신규 플레이어들의 등장 – 무한경쟁의 시대최근, 이 같은 흐름을 타고 강력한 고객 기반을 확보한 대형 플랫폼 기업이 속속 종합 금융업에 진출하고 있다. 카카오, 네이버, 토스 등 결제·송금 서비스 위주로 시장에 진입했던 기업들은 이제 은행, 증권, 보험 서비스로 사업 영역을 확대하고 있다. 향후 금융 서비스의 급격한 지형 변화가 예측되는 부분이다. 특히 핀테크, 테크핀 기업들의 경쟁도 주목된다.지금까지 은행권이 IT 기술을 도입하는 ‘핀테크’ 개념이 일반적이었다면, 처음부터 기술 기업으로 시작한 이들이 금융업에 도전하며 만든 서비스는 ‘테크핀’으로 규정된다. 고도의 디지털 기술을 기반으로 한층 진보적이며 소비자 친화적인 서비스를 만들어낼 수 있는 테크핀 기업들은 보수적인 금융 시장에 또 다른 경쟁지점을 만들어 내고 있다.아울러 제3의 인터넷전문은행 등장도 주목할 만하다. 올해 4월에는 인터넷전문은행 개정법이 통과됐고, 내년 7월에는 새로운 인터넷전문은행 ‘토스뱅크(TossBank)’ 출범이 예정돼 있다. 특히 인터넷전문은행이 증가는 비대면 금융 서비스 확대와 저신용자 포용금융 확대를 위한 중금리 대출 시장의 확장을 가속할 것으로 보인다.카카오, 네이버, 토스의 최근 행보 /자료=삼정KPMG코로나19는 위기이자 성장의 기회최근 코로나19 확산으로 경제 불확실성이 높아졌지만 금융업에는 오히려 기회가 되기도 했다. 사회적 거리두기의 일상화로 비대면(Untact) 금융이 부상했고, 이에 따른 디지털 금융 수요도 빠르게 증가하리란 예측 때문이다.발표자 김세호 삼정 KPMG 상무는 “핀테크는 이제 일상 속 필수 산업으로 자리 잡았다”며 “과도한 경쟁보다는 유관기관과 전통 금융사, 핀테크 기업 간의 상호지원을 통한 상생이 필요한 시점”이라고 말했다.이건한 기자(sugyo@bloter.net)[블로터 바로가기] ▶ 네이버 메인에서 블로터 뉴스 구독하기 ▶ 블로터 아카데미에서 마케팅 역량을 키우세요 ▶ 확장 가능 애자일 조직, 디지털 성장의 핵심동력  저작권자 ⓒ(주)블로터앤미디어, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=105&oid=293&aid=0000028432

2020.06.01.	코리아헤럴드	S. Korea to invest $15m in ADB funds	(Yonhap)The Ministry of Finance and Ministry of SMEs and Startups said Monday they will invest $15 million (18.4 billion won) in the Asian Development Bank’s upcoming new fund program to help early-stage startups here to expand their business into Southeast Asia regions. The Ventures Facility Investment Fund is aimed at financing small and medium-sized companies in business sectors like agriculture, public sanitation or fintech that foster sustainable economic growth in Southeast Asian countries. It is a type of social impact investing, which seeks for positive impacts on social problems alongside financial gain, the ministry said. The Korean government will finance the ADB’s new fund through its two separate funds -- a fund of funds operated by the Ministry of SMEs and Startups as well as e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, set up by the Finance Ministry to support developing nations in the Asia-Pacific region. Each fund will invest $10 million and $5 million, respectively. The Ministry of SMEs and Startups’ fund of funds -- a mutual investment vehicle that contains different types of funds has continued social investing since 2018, but has not yet invested in the international financial institution, the ministry officials said. Korean companies focusing on quarantine services or other promising social ventures will further get a boost from the government-led investment in terms of exports since the new fund will also finance domestic firms, which plan to expand its business into Southeast Asia regions. The total amount to be deposited in the fund will reach $60 million. Along with the Korean government, Finland, Denmark’s Climate Investment Fund and the Nordic Development Fund -- the joint development finance organization consisted of the five Nordic countries including Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden also plan to invest in $20.2 million, $10.3 million and $10 million, respectively.“The government expects its investment in the ADB fund will extend local startups’ reach in Southeast Asian countries, strengthening a strategic partnership with the regional development bank,” said an official. The ADB’s new fund program will be launched during its annual meeting held in Songdo, Incheon, on Sept. 18-21.Meanwhile, the government officials will co-host an investment relations conference with the ADB, introducing venture companies and startups in different industries.Launched in 1968, the ADB has stepped up efforts to tackle poverty issues and promote environmentally sustainable and inclusive growth in the Asia-Pacific region, with participation by a total of 68 member countries including Korea, the United States and Japan as well as China. By Choi Jae-hee (cjh@heraldcorp.com)[네이버에서 코리아헤럴드 구독]▶ KH Podcast     ▶ KH Video<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000218708
2020.02.17.	노컷뉴스	민주, 종로 이낙연·양산을 김두관 등 4곳 전략공천	남양주병엔  검찰개혁 김용민·고양병엔 경제전문가 홍정민동작을 등 8개 지역 전략공천 추가 지정도 의결금태섭지역 출마 김남국엔 "당과 교감 없었다"[CBS노컷뉴스 이준규 기자](사진=연합뉴스)더불어민주당은 17일 4·15 총선에서 서울 종로에 이낙연 전 국무총리, 경남 양산을에 김두관 의원, 경기 남양주 병에 김용민 변호사, 경기 고양병에 홍정민 변호사를 전략공천하기로 결정했다.민주당 최고위원회는 이날 당 전략공천위원회가 지정한 대로 이들을 각 지역 후보로 최종 의결했다.민주당 이근형 전략기획위원장은 "이 전 총리의 경우 아시다시피 국민의 신뢰를 많이 받고 있는 총리 출신"이라며 "당 총선 승리를 위한 의지, 본인의 의지를 높이 사 전략공천 후보로 판정했다"고 밝혔다.이 위원장은 "김두관 의원은 현 지역구가 김포갑 임에도 불구하고 당과 지도부의 간곡한 출마 요청 제안을 수용해 경남지역 선거를 진두지휘하는 역할까지 같이 해줄 것을 기대한다"고 설명했다.홍정민 변호사에 대해서는 "인공지능(AI)과 정보통신(IT), 핀테크(Fintech) 산업 분야의 전문성을 갖추고 있고 경제학박사 학위와 사법시험 합격 2가지를 30대 초반에 동시에 이뤄낸 경제전문가"라며 "고양시의 경제를 업그레이드할 수 있는 적임자로 판단했다"고 말했다.김용민 변호사에 대해서는 "시대정신이라 볼 수 있는 권력기관 개혁 완수를 위해 필요한 적임자"라며 "약자 편에 서서 억울하게 고통 받는 이들을 대변해 온 정의로운 변호사라는 것을 종합적으로 고려해 남양주병 지역에 추천했다"고 말했다.민주당 최고위는 지난 15일 서울 동작을 등 8곳을 추가로 전략공천 지역으로 지정해 달라는 당 공천관리위원회의 요청 또한 이날 의결했다.당 전략공천위는 이들 지역에 대한 후보 또한 심사·의결해 당 지도부에 결과를 보고해야 한다.이날 최고위에서는 8개 지역 중 4개 지역을 전략지역으로 지정하면 안 된다는 이견이 나왔지만 최종적으로는 모두 전략지역으로 지정됐다.한편 이 위원장은 오는 18일 서울 강서갑 민주당 예비후보로 등록할 것으로 알려진 김남국 변호사에 대해서는 당 지도부와 교감하지 않은 "개인적 판단으로 봐야 한다"고 말했다.강서갑은 지난해 조국 전 법무장관의 임명과 고위공직자범죄수사처 설치 등에 반대하는 등 당의 주된 기류와 어긋나는 소신을 펼쳤던 금태섭 의원의 지역구다.정봉주 전 의원이 금 의원 저격을 예고하며 이 지역에서 출마를 선언했지만 '부적격' 판정을 받으며 낙마했다.이로 인해 금 의원의 단수 공천이 유력했지만 당이 추가 공모를 결정하면서 새로운 경쟁자가 나타날지에 관심이 모였다.이러던 중 김 변호사가 출마 의사를 밝히면서 일각에서는 금 의원을 꺼려하는 당 지도부와 김 변호사 간에 교감이 있었던 것 아니냐는 관측이 제기되기도 했다.▶ 총선2020 관련기사 모음▶ 인싸들의 선택, 노컷뉴스 구독 서비스▶ 노컷이 못한 일, 돈컷은 한다findlove@cbs.co.kr저작권자 © CBS 노컷뉴스 무단전재 및 재배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=100&oid=079&aid=0003323887
2020.04.01.	media KHAN	쿠팡, 본격 ‘쿠페이’ 키운다...핀테크 사업부 분사	쿠팡이 자체 결제 시스템 확대를 위해 관련 사업부를 자회사로 독립시킨다. 1일 쿠팡은 자체 결제 시스템인 ‘쿠페이’ 결제서비스를 담당하고 있는 핀테크(fintech) 사업부를 자회사 형식의 독립법인으로 분사해 ‘쿠팡페이(가칭)’를 설립하고 상반기 중 본격적인 사업에 나선다고 밝혔다.쿠팡이 제공하는 핀테크 서비스인 ‘쿠페이(이전 명칭 로켓페이)’는 사용 등록 인원이 지난해 6월 기준 1000만명을 돌파했다. 금융감독원의 ‘2018년 간편결제서비스현황’ 자료에 따르면 거래액 규모론 스마일페이, 네이버페이에 이어 국내 3위다. 비밀번호를 입력하거나 지문인식을 통해 본인을 인증하는 과정 없이 자체 개발한 부정거래 감지 시스템을 활용해 구매 버튼을 누르면 결제가 완료되는 ‘원터치 결제’ 시스템이 특징이다.온라인 쇼핑몰들은 저마다 자체 결제 시스템 구축 및 확대에 공을 들여왔다. 별도의 복잡한 인증 절차 없이 간편하게 결제가 가능하다는 점 외에도 해당 쇼핑몰 구매 시 자체 포인트 혜택 등을 제공하면서 특정 사이트를 지속적으로 이용하게 하는 ‘충성 고객’ 모집 효과가 있기 때문이다. 현재 자체 결제 시스템을 운영하고 있는 쇼핑몰엔 네이버(네이버페이), G마켓·옥션(스마일페이), 11번가(SK페이) 등이 있다. 이런 자체 결제 시스템들은 자사 플랫폼 외에도 다양한 협업을 통해 이용처를 확장해가고 있다.신설된 자회사의 대표직은 2014년에 쿠팡에 입사해 소프트웨어 엔지니어링, 핀테크 등 간편결제 시스템 기술 총괄 업무를 수행해온 경인태 디렉터(45)가 맡는다.경 대표는 “신설되는 핀테크 자회사는 고객들에게 보다 편하고 혁신적인 금융서비스를 제공하면서 간편결제를 넘어 고객을 위한 종합 핀테크 플랫폼으로 발전할 것”이라며 “핀테크 부문에서도 쿠팡에서만 경험할 수 있는 차별화 된 서비스를 선보이겠다”고 말했다.김지원 기자 deepdeep@kyunghyang.com▶ 장도리 | 그림마당 보기▶ 경향신문 바로가기▶ 경향신문 구독신청하기©경향신문(www.khan.co.kr), 무단전재 및 재배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=032&aid=0003001307

KB국민카드는 신용대출, 자동차대출 등 소비자 금융 사업을 하는 태국 여신전문금융회사 ‘제이 핀테크(J Fintech)’ 지분 인수를 위한 신주인수계약을 맺었다. 총 인수 대금은 248억원(6억 5000만 바트)으로 KB국민카드는 제이 핀테크의 의결권 지분 50.99%를 보유하게 된다.   제이 핀테크는 태국 내 휴대전화 유통과 채권 추심 1위 업체를 계열사로 보유한 ‘제이마트(Jaymart)’ 그룹의 금융 자회사다. KB국민카드는 이번 계약을 통해 태국에서 신용대출, 자동차대출 등 대출 사업과 신용카드 사업을 영위할 수 있게 됐다.   2011년 설립된 이 회사는 임직원 130여 명에 18개 영업소를 보유하고 있다. 지난해 말 기준 총자산 1516억 원, 당기순이익 26억원을 기록했다.   이번 계약은 이동철 사장 부임 이후 진행된 캄보디아, 인도네시아에 이은 3번째 해외 금융회사 인수다. 이에 따라 올 초 이 사장이 신년사에서 언급한 동남아시아 국가를 중심 해외 사업의 확장 전략에도 한 층 가속도가 붙을 것으로 보인다.   특히 이번 진출은 1998년 국제통화기금(IMF) 사태 이후 국내 은행과 여신전문금융회사가 신규 인허가 또는 인수합병 등을 통해 태국에 진출한 최초의 사례다. 향후 KB국민은행 등 KB금융그룹 주요 계열사들의 태국 시장 진출에도 교두보 역할을 수행할 것으로 기대된다.   태국 소비자 금융 시장은 2018년 기준 약 410조 원 규모로 추산되며 최근 5년 평균 8%에 이르는 안정적인 성장세를 이어가고 있다. 또 동남아시아 최고 수준의 신용 인프라를 구축하고 있고, 정부의 캐시리스(Cashless) 정책에 힘입어 신용카드 시장도 연 평균 7% 이상 성장하는 각종 신용 사업이 용이한 것으로 평가 받고 있다.   KB국민카드는 한국과 태국 금융 당국의 승인 절차와 인수 계약을 마무리하는 ‘딜 클로징(Deal Closing)’등을 거쳐 이르면 연말께 공식 자회사로 편입할 계획이다.  king@fnnews.com 이용안 기자   ▶ 헉! 소리나는 스!토리 뉴스 [헉스]▶ '아는 척'하고 싶은 당신을 위한 [두유노우]  ※ 저작권자 ⓒ 파이낸셜뉴스. 무단 전재-재배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=014&aid=0004415239

KB국민카드는 신용대출, 자동차대출 등 소비자 금융 사업을 하는 태국 여신전문금융회사 ‘제이 핀테크(J Fintech)’ 지분 인수를 위한 신주인수계약을 맺었다. 총 인수 대금은 248억원(6억 5000만 바트)으로 KB국민카드는 제이 핀테크의 의결권 지분 50.99%를 보유하게 된다.   제이 핀테크는 태국 내 휴대전화 유통과 채권 추심 1위 업체를 계열사로 보유한 ‘제이마트(Jaymart)’ 그룹의 금융 자회사다. KB국민카드는 이번 계약을 통해 태국에서 신용대출, 자동차대출 등 대출 사업과 신용카드 사업을 영위할 수 있게 됐다.   2011년 설립된 이 회사는 임직원 130여 명에 18개 영업소를 보유하고 있다. 지난해 말 기준 총자산 1516억 원, 당기순이익 26억원을 기록했다.   이번 계약은 이동철 사장 부임 이후 진행된 캄보디아, 인도네시아에 이은 3번째 해외 금융회사 인수다. 이에 따라 올 초 이 사장이 신년사에서 언급한 동남아시아 국가를 중심 해외 사업의 확장 전략에도 한 층 가속도가 붙을 것으로 보인다.   특히 이번 진출은 1998년 국제통화기금(IMF) 사태 이후 국내 은행과 여신전문금융회사가 신규 인허가 또는 인수합병 등을 통해 태국에 진출한 최초의 사례다. 향후 KB국민은행 등 KB금융그룹 주요 계열사들의 태국 시장 진출에도 교두보 역할을 수행할 것으로 기대된다.   태국 소비자 금융 시장은 2018년 기준 약 410조 원 규모로 추산되며 최근 5년 평균 8%에 이르는 안정적인 성장세를 이어가고 있다. 또 동남아시아 최고 수준의 신용 인프라를 구축하고 있고, 정부의 캐시리스(Cashless) 정책에 힘입어 신용카드 시장도 연 평균 7% 이상 성장하는 각종 신용 사업이 용이한 것으로 평가 받고 있다.   KB국민카드는 한국과 태국 금융 당국의 승인 절차와 인수 계약을 마무리하는 ‘딜 클로징(Deal Closing)’등을 거쳐 이르면 연말께 공식 자회사로 편입할 계획이다.  king@fnnews.com 이용안 기자   ▶ 헉! 소리나는 스!토리 뉴스 [헉스]▶ '아는 척'하고 싶은 당신을 위한 [두유노우]  ※ 저작권자 ⓒ 파이낸셜뉴스. 무단 전재-재배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=014&aid=0004415239

2020.05.11.	연합뉴스	S Korea-data exchange	S. Korea opens financial data exchange   SEOUL, May 11 (Yonhap) -- South Korea on Monday opened its first exchange for financial data, the financial regulator said, in a move that could boost the data-driven economy.   The exchange will serve as a key platform for buyers and sellers of financial, telecommunication and corporate data. It is meant to facilitate financial big data, according to the Financial Services Commission.   "The government will ensure that the financial data exchange will take root as an innovative infrastructure of financial companies, fintech companies and startups," Sohn Byung-doo, vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission, said in a speech at the opening ceremony at a Seoul hotel.   The move came four months after South Korea's parliament passed three bills designed to ease regulations on the use of personal information, despite objections from privacy advocates.   The three bills related to data are intended to enable the use of personal information offered under an alias and processed technologically to conceal the provider's identity, without the user's consent, for compiling statistics and industrial research purposes.   In 2018, President Moon Jae-in stated that the "data economy" is a key to South Korea's innovative growth. He expressed his determination to improve the legal system so that South Korea can emerge as a global powerhouse in data use, beyond just being an internet-savvy nation.   entropy@yna.co.kr(END)	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=001&aid=0011600984

2020.06.09.	코리아중앙데일리	Eight Toss accounts see fraudulent transactions	Toss [YONHAP]      Fraudulent transactions were made through Toss, Korea’s popular money transfer service, raising trust issues for a fintech company with more than 17 million subscribers in the country. A total of 9.38 million won ($7,800) was wrongly moved from eight users' accounts on June 3 by three websites including a U.S.-based game giant, Blizzard.    Viva Republica, parent company of Toss, said identity theft was behind the unauthorized transactions, not hacking.    “Even if the Toss system is hacked, it is impossible for it to lead to transactions because the system’s database doesn’t save users’ passwords,” a Toss spokesman said Tuesday.      “It seems like users’ personal information was leaked elsewhere.” The company said that it immediately suspended four of the eight victims' accounts when they filed complaints on June 3.     One customer saw four unauthorized transactions from a website she has never used, each for approximately 500,000 won.    In the process of investigating the issue, Toss found there were four similar cases, and it suspended those accounts and notified the users.    All fraudulent transactions were refunded a day later on June 4.      The fraudulent transactions were made on Toss's website, not through its mobile app. Webpage transactions account for merely 5 percent of the transactions by Toss customers, or 1 percent if measured in transaction value.    Website payments require input of a user’s personal data including name, phone number and birthday and a five-digit Toss password comprised of four numbers and one letter.      There is no additional authentication required, such as input of a verification code sent to a user’s mobile phone, which is why app-based transactions are considered more secure.    Toss said it stopped webpage transactions for the three websites involved.     The company said it will cooperate with police to track down the perpetrator and find out how users' personal information got leaked.     Toss was developed by unicorn start-up Viva Republica and has been a big success. It has more than 17 million users and has transferred a total of 90 trillion won since its launch in 2015 through last month. Toss was planning to expand its finance business by launching a brokerage service this year and an online bank next year.    Viva Republica CEO Lee Seung-gun recently revealed a plan to go for an initial public offering within the next two to three years.     “Although it happened because of misuse of users’ personal data, Toss will fortify its systems looking for abnormal transactions so that no fraud can take place on the platform,” the company said in a statement.

2020.06.04.	디지털데일리	핀테크 기업에 클라우드 제공, 한국핀테크지원센터 클라우드 사업자 선정 나서	[디지털데일리 이상일기자] 금융권의 클라우드 이용이 확산되고 있는 가운데 핀테크 기업을 대상으로 클라우드 확산을 위한 지원사업이 진행된다. 4일 관련업계에 따르면 한국핀테크지원센터는 핀테크 기업이 안전성을 갖춘 클라우드를 통해 혁신 서비스를 개발 및 테스트하고 신기술을 활용할 수 있도록 금융 클라우드 이용을 지원키로 하고 서비스를 제공하기 위한 금융 클라우드 사업자 선정에 나섰다. 핀테크 기업이 혁신 아이디어를 빠르게 서비스화하고 경제적으로 운용할 수 있는 환경 지원으로 조기 시장 정착 및 기업의 성장을 뒷받침하는 한편 인프라 보안 및 데이터 보호가 보장되는 안전한 핀테크 서비스 환경 조성으로 불의의 금융사고 등을 예방하겠다는 전략이다. 한국핀테크지원센터는 클라우드 제공 사업자 선정을 통해 핀테크 기업 50개사 이상에 클라우드 인프라를 제공할 계획이다. 올해 처음으로 진행되는 핀테크 기업에 대한 클라우드 지원 사업은 12월 마무리되며 사업평가를 통해 내년도 진행 여부를 결정할 전망이다. 그동안 핀테크 기업들은 IT인프라를 클라우드를 활용해 서비스를 구축, 제공해왔다. 초기 도입비용이 저렴하고 사용한 만큼 과금하는 클라우드 인프라는 사업을 처음 시작하는 스타트업이나 기술기업에게 장점으로 작용해왔다. 또한 클라우드 이용을 통해 소규모 회사에서 소홀할 수 있는 보안 시스템 등을 안정적으로 운영, 제공받는다는 것도 장점 중 하나였다. 때문에 금융그룹 차원에서 운영되는 핀테크 육성프로그램에서는 AWS, MS애저, NBP 등 다양한 클라우드 업체와 협력을 맺고 육성 기업에게 클라우드 시스템을 제공하는 등의 지원정책을 펴왔다. 한국핀테크지원센터는 올해 마포 공덕에 오픈하는 마포 청년혁신타운 '프론트원(Front 1)'에서 운영 예정인 핀테크 특화 보육프로그램 ‘핀테크큐브(Fintech Cube)’에 예비창업자 포함 최대 25개사 내외를 추가 선발할 계획으로 핀테크 육성 프로그램을 보다 다채롭게 진행하고 있다.핀테크큐브는 핀테크 기업 보육을 위한 전용 사무공간 입주기업을 선발하고 전문 운영사를 통해 지원하는 맞춤형 보육 프로그램이다. 이는 금융위원회 '맞춤형 성장지원 프로그램'의 일환으로 진행되는데 보안이 확보된 IT인프라 제공을 통해 핀테크 업체들의 초기 부담을 줄이는데 도움을 줄 전망이다.한편 한국핀테크지원센터는 국내 소재 클라우드 데이터센터를 운영하고 있으며 금융 클라우드컴퓨팅서비스 제공자 안전성 평가를 준수하는 사업자를 대상으로 IaaS 및 PaaS 상품을 제공하고 웹을 통한 클라우드 자원(서버 등)의 자동 생성, 관리 및 모니터링 기능 등을 제공하는 업체를 선정한다는 계획이다.  <이상일 기자>2401@ddaily.co.kr뉴스채널 설정 - 네이버 메인에서 디지털데일리 뉴스를 볼 수 있어요.IT정보의 즐거운 업그레이드[딜라이트닷넷]<저작권자 © 디지털데일리 무단전재-재배포금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=105&oid=138&aid=0002086884

2020.04.14.	연합뉴스	블루바이저, 영국 핀테크 액셀러레이터 프로그램 2년 연속 선정	▲ 본투글로벌센터(센터장 김종갑) 멤버사인 블루바이저는 영국왕립은행 RBS에서 후원하는 핀테크 스타트업 육성 프로그램(NatWest FinTech Accelerator Programme)에 2년 연속 선정됐다고 14일 밝혔다.    블루바이저는 오는 8월까지 영국왕립은행 RBS의 자회사인 금융기업 냇웨스트가 운영하는 핀테크 전문 액셀러레이팅 프로그램에 참여하게 되며, 영국왕립은행으로부터 운영 비용 전액을 지원받는다.    냇웨스트는 성장 가능성이 높고 유망한 전 세계 스타트업을 심사해 지원 기업을 선정하고, 선발 기업에 영국 현지 핀테크 기반 기술 투자 유치, 글로벌 네트워킹 등을 제공한다.    블루바이저는 지난해 9월에 이어 올해 지원 기업에 연속 선정되며 글로벌 시장성과 현지화 가능성을 인정받았다.    냇웨스트는 영국 현지에서 액셀러레이팅 프로그램을 진행할 예정이었으나 신종 코로나바이러스 감염증(코로나19)의 확산으로 온라인으로 임시 대체 프로그램을 운영 중이며, 블루바이저도 지난 1일 온라인 프로그램에 참여했다.    황용국 대표는 "영국 런던 허브 내 다양한 기업과 네트워킹을 확보하고 지속적 매출 성장을 통해 125개 기업 중 높은 평가를 받으며 2년 연속 냇웨스트 프로그램에 선정됐다"고 말했다.    황 대표는 "한국에서 개발한 인공지능 제품 하이버프(HIGHBUFF)의 기술성과 신뢰성, 시장성 등을 영국에서 인정받은 만큼 글로벌 시장을 대상으로 한 지속적 세일즈를 통해 기술 우수성과 가치를 높여나갈 것"이라고 덧붙였다.     블루바이저는 2017년 설립된 핀테크 스타트업으로, 인공지능 재테크 솔루션 하이버프를 개발한 바 있다.    하이버프는 인공지능을 통해 투자 포트폴리오 도출, 자산 배분, 투자 실행, 모니터링, 리밸런싱 등 재테크의 전 과정을 지원하는 솔루션 프로그램으로, PC와 스마트폰 등에 설치해 사용할 수 있다.

2020.02.06.	스포츠서울	한화금융 계열사, 디지털 전환 가속화한다	[스포츠서울 권오철 기자] 한화금융 계열사(생명, 손해보험, 투자증권, 자산운용)가 디지털 트랜스포메이션의 일환으로, 새로운 성과관리체계인 ‘OKR(Objective and Key Results)’을 도입한다고 6일 밝혔다. OKR은 IT기업이나 스타트업에서 사용된 반면 국내 금융사에서는 낯선 지표인데, 이번에 한화금융 계열사가 선제적으로 도입했다. 디지털 기반으로 재편되고 있는 금융환경에서, 민첩하고 유연하게 대응할 수 있는 조직문화를 장착하기 위한 방법으로 OKR을 선택한 것이다.한화그룹 김승연 회장은 올해 신년사에서 “전사차원의 디지털 트랜스포메이션을 가속화해 4차산업혁명시대의 경쟁력을 적극 확보해야 한다”고 강조한 바 있다. OKR은 ‘어떤 방향으로 갈 것인가(Objective)’와 ‘그곳에 가고 있다는 것을 어떻게 알 수 있는지(Key results)’의 합성어로 변화하는 환경에 맞춰 지속적으로 추적하고 변화해가는 새로운 성과관리체계다. 구글, 유튜브, 페이스북 등 포춘 500대 글로벌 기업의 25%가 실행하고 있다. 특히 40명의 소수 조직이었던 구글이 글로벌 기업으로 성장하는데 가장 결정적 요인인 것으로 알려져 있다.한화금융 계열사는 OKR을 도입하기에 앞서, 지난해부터 특정 업무 단위에 애자일(Agile) 업무 방식 도입을 추진했다. 주요 금융 계열사인 한화생명은 미래전략실, 기술전략실, 글로벌네트워크본부 등 미래 혁신을 추진하는 주요 본부를 애자일 조직으로 운영해 오고 있으며, 한화투자증권도 작년 Agile혁신실을 신설한 바 있다.부서 간 경계를 허물고 필요에 맞게 소규모 팀을 구성해 업무를 수행하는 애자일 조직의 특성상, 새로운 성과관리체계의 필요성도 커졌다. 이에 한화금융 계열사는 올해부터 조직단위별 OKR을 수립해 적용한다. 성공적인 안착을 위해 수립한 OKR 진척도를 수시 모니터링 할 수 있는 IT 시스템도 구축한다. 또한 운영 전담조직과 코치를 양성하고, 중간점검 및 리뷰를 할 수 있는 협의체도 마련할 계획이다.OKR의 가장 큰 특징은 기존 성과관리지표인 KPI(Key Performance Indicator)에 비해 스피드를 최대한 끌어 올렸다는 것이다. KPI는 연 단위 평가인데 비해, OKR은 짧게는 수 주, 길게는 분기 단위로 목표 관리가 가능하다. 대내외 환경에 민첩하게 대응할 수 있어, 디지털 혁신 시대에 가장 적합한 지표로 평가 받고 있다. 또한 OKR은 회사가 먼저 목표를 정하면, 부서와 직원이 자발적으로 목표를 설정하는 쌍방향 방식이다. 반면, KPI는 지금도 대부분의 기업들이 사용하는 지표로서, 주로 Top-down(하향식)으로 목표 수립이 이뤄진다.한화금융 계열사 관계자는 “핀테크(FinTech)가 아닌 테크핀(TechFin)이라는 말이 나올 정도로 디지털 기술이 금융업 전반을 견인한다고 볼 수 있다”며, “이번 전사적 OKR 도입으로 새로운 환경에 유연하게 대응함으로써, 한화금융 계열사들의 디지털 트랜스포메이션이 가속화 될 것으로 기대한다”고 밝혔다. konplash@sportsseoul.com[기사제보 news@sportsseoul.com]  Copyright ⓒ 스포츠서울&sportsseoul.com	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=468&aid=0000623532

[연합뉴스]           ‘민주사회를 위한 변호사 모임(민변)’ 출신인 김용민 변호사는 대표적인 ‘친(親)조국’ 인사로 분류된다. 조 전 장관 시절 형사사건 공개 금지 규칙, 직접수사 부서 축소·폐지 등 굵직한 검찰 관련 정책이 그가 활동했던 법무부 법무·검찰개혁위에서 나왔다. 이근형 민주당 전략기획위원장은 그를 “시대정신인 권력기관 개혁 완수를 위해 필요한 적임자”라고 소개했다.김용민 변호사가 출마할 경기 남양주병의 현역 의원은 주광덕 미래통합당 의원이다. 주 의원은 조 전 장관 인사청문회 등에서 대표적인 ‘저격수’였다. 김용민 변호사의 전략공천으로 남양주병에서는 ‘친조국’ 대 ‘반(反)조국’의 맞대결이 벌어지게 됐다.        지난해 9월 26일 조국 당시 법무부 장관이 국회 본회의에 출석, 자유한국당(미래통합당의 전신) 주광덕 의원의 질의를 듣고 있다.

[뉴스1]    Q : 왜 강서갑인가. A : “지난해 서초동 집회에 참여했을 때 누군가 저를 강서에 사는 것으로 소문을 잘못 내서, 이후 강서갑 주민들로부터 출마 요청을 받아 왔다.”  Q : 뭐라고 하던가. A : “(금 의원이)강서를 너무 홀대했다는 이야기도 하시고, 소통 부족도 이야기하시고 그렇더라. 지난주 민주당원들이 (금 의원의 공수처법 기권 표결에 대해) 반발하는 그런 일도 있었고.”  Q : ‘조국 대 반(反)조국’의 대결이라고들 하는데. A : “그보다도 민생이라든가, 청년정치가 꽃을 피우는 길을 만들고 싶다.”  Q : 조국 색깔은 벗고 싶나. A : “조국 교수님은 은사님이고 또 친하다. 그렇게 하면 교수님이 서운해하실 것 같다.”  Q : 강서갑 이외 고민한 곳은. A :  "지금 사는 곳이 서울 동작구라 동작을 출마도 함께 고민했다."    이낙연 국무총리(왼쪽), 김두관 의원(가운데) 등이 지난달 22일 서울 용산구 백범김구기념관에서 열린 더불어민주당 제21대 총선 입후보자 교육연수에서 국민의례하고 있다.

2020.06.10.	아시아경제신문	삼성생명, 태국 핀테크 투자·中 영업망 확대…해외사업 '활활'	태국법인 3년 연속 흑자…영업조직 경쟁력 강화中 합작 법인 수입보험료 1조5000억 넘어[아시아경제 오현길 기자] 20여년 전 동남아 보험시장에 진출했지만 이렇다할 성과를 내지 못했던 삼성생명이 현지 사업 확장에 보폭을 넓히고 있다. 중국에서 운영 중인 합작법인 수입보험료도 1조5000억원을 넘어서면서 순항 중이다. 독보적인 국내 영업 실적에 비해 '아픈 손가락' 취급을 받아왔던 해외사업이 서서히 성장궤도에 오르고 있다는 평가가 나온다.10일 보험업계에 따르면 삼성생명의 중국과 태국법인은 지난해 현지 고객으로 부터 1조7364억원의 수입보험료를 거둬들였다. 이는 전년 동기 1조3624억원 대비 27.4% 증가한 수치다. 중국법인이 1조5821억원, 태국법인이 1543억원을 기록했다. 세전이익은 중국법인이 86억원, 태국법인이 13억원으로 지난해 같은기간 대비 각각 48.2%, 44.4% 신장했다.1997년 태국 방콕에 설립된 타이삼성생명보험은 2017년 흑자 전환에 성공했다. 이후 3년 연속 흑자 기조를 이어가는 중이다. 태국 보험시장은 최근 5년 기준 연 평균 수입보험료가 4% 증가할 정도로 커지는 추세다. 22개 생명보험사가 영업 중으로 이 중 12곳이 외국계다. 외국계사의 시장점유율은 71%에 달한다.타이삼성은 설계사 7800여명을 확보하고 방콕에 3곳, 동부와 남부, 북부, 북동부에 각 1곳씩 영업지점을 운영 중이다. 태국 전역에 114개 영업소가 있다. 5개 육성센터를 활용한 설계사 육성을 통해 영업조직의 경쟁력 강화에 매진하고 있다. 특히 타이삼성은 주요 은행과 방카슈랑스(은행 창구에서 보험을 판매하는 영업) 채널 업무 제휴를 통해 영업망을 확대하고 중장기적으로 중소형사에 대한 인수합병(M&A) 등도 추진할 예정이다.지난해에는 벤처나 신산업 투자를 목적으로 하는 전략투자펀드(CVC)를 통해 태국 1위 금융상품 판매 플랫폼인 '래빗파이낸스'에 지분 투자에 나서기도 했다. 래빗파이낸스는 온라인으로 금융상품이나 보험을 중개해주는 핀테크(Fintech) 기업이다. 삼성생명은 타이삼성의 상품판매 플랫폼과 제휴 채널로 활용한다는 계획이다.중국시장에도 잰걸음 행보에 나서고 있다. 2005년 중국항공과 함께 설립한 중국 법인, 중은삼성인수보험은 2015년 중국은행이 새로운 주주로 참여, 성장세를 이어가고 있다. 총 자산은 작년말 기준 3조7369억원 규모로, 삼성생명이 지분 25%를 보유 중이다.최근에는 장기 연금과 보장성 상품 등 고수익 상품판매 비중을 확대하면서 수익성 확보에 한창이다. CVC를 활용해 중국 내 헬스케어 서비스 업체에도 투자를 진행하고 있다. 중은삼성은 중국은행의 방카슈랑스 채널을 기반으로 중견 생보사로 도약한다는 목표다. 삼성물산과 중국에 합작 설립한 북경삼성치업은 현재 북경 중심업무지구에 건물을 건설 중에 있다. 건물 완공 후 사무실 임대사업에 나설 예정이다.삼성생명 관계자는 "해외법인에서 성과가 서서히 나타나고 있다"면서 "중국이나 태국 외에 성장 잠재력이 높은 동남아시아를 중심으로 사업을 확대할 계획"이라고 말했다.오현길 기자 ohk0414@asiae.co.kr▶ 2020년 하반기, 재물운·연애운·건강운 체크!▶ 네이버에서 아시아경제 뉴스를 받아보세요 ▶ 놀 준비 되었다면 드루와!  드링킷!<ⓒ경제를 보는 눈, 세계를 보는 창 아시아경제 무단전재 배포금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=277&aid=0004695577
2020.02.17.	연합뉴스	finance ministry-policy report	S. Korea to draw up further measures to contain economic impact of coronavirus By Kim Deok-hyun   SEJONG, Feb. 17 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's finance ministry said Monday it will draw up additional measures to preemptively contain the economic impact of the novel coronavirus, which is expected to threaten the fragile Chinese and global economies.   In a policy report to President Moon Jae-in, the Ministry of Economy and Finance said the nation's consumption is feeling the pinch of the virus because people have shunned crowds over fears of infection.   The nation's aviation, hotel and restaurant sectors are expected to take a harder hit from the COVID-19 virus outbreak, as a large proportion of visitors come from China.   Earlier this month, the ministry said it will provide 2 trillion won (US$1.7 billion) in financial support to small merchants who are expected to be hurt by the spread of the virus.    Also on Monday, the ministry said it provide 300 billion won in emergency loans to local budget carriers. Budget carriers will also be exempted from paying airport usage fees.   The government will set up a fund of 60 billion won to help support the nation's shipping industry.   South Korea has reported 30 confirmed cases of the virus so far, with nine patients having fully recovered from the illness.President Moon Jae-in (4th from R) speaks during a meeting with business leaders to discuss ways to get over the coronavirus crisis at the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Seoul on Feb. 13, 2020. (Yonhap)With uncertainty lingering about the peak of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,700 people and infected 70,000, mostly in China, South Korea is stepping up efforts to minimize the economic impact of the disease.    Vice Finance Minister Kim Yong-beom told reporters that the ministry will mobilize policy banks and loans to aggressively contain the economic impact of the virus.    However, the government has not been considering an extra budget because of the difficulty of gauging how broadly the virus will spread, Kim said.    The economic impact of the virus could be assessed in late March, when economic indexes of February industrial activities will be announced, Kim said.    South Korea's economy grew 2 percent last year, its slowest growth in a decade. The nation's finance ministry has predicted the economy will grow 2.4 percent this year.   Hit by a trade war between the United States and China, South Korea's exports fell 10.3 percent on-year in 2019 to $542.4 billion.    Concerns are growing over South Korea's export performance down the road amid the coronavirus epidemic.    In the policy report, the ministry said it designated 10 industrial sectors for deregulation, including artificial intelligence and biotechnology, to help them develop technologies and services with fewer regulatory hurdles.    Other industrial sectors include mobility services, new medical technologies, biotechnology, fintech, tourism and e-commerce, it said.    Companies in the industrial sectors are expected to develop products without regulatory hurdles. Under a so-called regulatory sandbox, they are expected to be exempted from strict regulations.   The ministry said it has set aside 15.8 trillion won in budget for innovation-led growth this year, up 46 percent from a year ago.   kdh@yna.co.kr(END)	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=001&aid=0011406106

Korea to draw up further measures to contain economic impact of coronavirus(ATTN: UPDATES with finance minister's remarks in first 5 paras; CHANGES photo)  By Kim Deok-hyun   SEJONG, Feb. 17 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's finance minister said Monday the government will draw up a package of comprehensive measures to preemptively contain the economic impact of the novel coronavirus, which is expected to threaten the fragile Chinese and global economies.   In a policy report to President Moon Jae-in, Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said the measures, including policy tools to support exports, consumption and investment, will be introduced by the end of this month.    Hong said the COVID-19 virus outbreak "has significantly contracted private investment, consumption and exports," citing daily data on sales at discount store chains and exports to China.    Hong called for people not to reduce their normal economic activities, saying excessive fear of the virus could hurt the economy.    On the financial markets, Hong said the government will swiftly take action to stabilize markets if volatility grows.

2020.04.21.	edaily	윤석헌 원장 "올해 금융감독업무 디지털 기반 구축"	'금융감독 디지털 전환TF' 첫 회의 주재[이데일리 이승현 기자] 금융당국이 감독업무의 디지털 전환을 본격 추진한다. 금융감독원은 21일 윤석헌 원장 주재로 ‘금융감독 디지털 전환 TF’의 첫번째 회의를 열었다고 밝혔다. 윤석헌 원장은 이 자리에서 이 TF를 통해 올해 디지털 전환 로드맵을 마련하고 3가지 우선과제를 추진하겠다고 밝혔다.3가지 과제는 △섭테크(Suptech)를 통한 감독업무 혁신 △레그테크(Regtech) 가속화 △핀테크(Fintech) 혁신 지속이다.섭테크는 금융감독(Supervision)업무에 디지털 기술(Technology)을 접목해 업무 효율성과 감독 역량을 강화하는 것이다. 금감원은 빅데이터 기반의 민원상담시스템 구축과 인공지능(AI)-빅데이터 기반 감독시스템 확충, 빅데이터 플랫폼 구축을 위한 감독정보 데이터 품질 진단, 업무 자동화 기술을 통한 감독행정 효율화 등을 제시했다.레그테크는 금융규제(Regulation)에 신기술(Technology)를 접목해 금융회사의 규제준수 활동을 효율화하는 것이다. 금감원은 이를 위해 국내외 레그테크 우수사례를 금융회사와 공유할 계획이다. 특히 컴플라이언스 조직이 약한 전자금융업자 등을 대상으로 자금세탁방지 업무 등에 레그테크를 활용하도록 유도할 방침이다.금감원은 또 핀테크 혁신 지속을 위해 정보공유체계를 마련하고 금융소비자 보호를 위한 대출사기 스팸문자 차단시스템을 확대키로 했다.금감원의 금융감독 디지털 전환 TF는 이날 첫 회의를 시작으로 오는 9월까지 로드맵을 마련할 예정이다. 윤석헌 원장은 “금융감독의 디지털 전환 여정은 멀고도 험난할 것이다. 신기술 도입이 중요하지만 이를 운영하는 우리의 인식전환이 쉽지만은 않을 것이기 때문”이라고 말했다. 그는 “성공적인 금융감독의 디지털 전환을 위해선 조직문화와 업무방식의 변화가 함께 이뤄져야 할 것”이라고 강조했다.윤석헌 금융감독원장.

2020.05.28.	edaily	아톤, `코리아 핀테크 위크 2020` 참가…"신규 고객사 확보"	[이데일리 이후섭 기자] 핀테크 보안기업 아톤(158430)은 28일부터 온라인으로 개최되는 `코리아 핀테크 위크 2020`에 참가한다고 밝혔다.금융위원회와 핀테크지원센터가 주최하는 이번 행사는 코로나19 확산 방지를 위해 온라인으로 진행되며, 핀테크 분야 핵심 트렌드인 `개방형 혁신(Fintech for Open Innovation)`을 주제로 147개 기업 및 기관이 참여해 혁신 핀테크 서비스를 소개하는 특별 세션과 온라인 전시 프로그램이 마련됐다.행사기간 동안 아톤은 핀테크 스케일업관을 통해 온라인 부스를 열고 `패스 인증서`를 비롯해 아톤의 혁신 보안·인증 기술을 일반 관람객도 쉽게 이해할 수 있도록 소개하고, 온라인 부스를 활용해 다중인증 또는 사설인증서 도입을 고려하고 있는 국내외 기관들과 미팅을 진행해 신규 사업에 대한 협력 방안을 모색할 계획이다.또 코리아 핀테크 위크 박람회 개최를 기념해 이날부터 30일까지 3일간 관람객을 대상으로 참여 이벤트를 실시한다. 이벤트 기간 중 아톤의 핀테크 보안 솔루션이 적용된 모바일 뱅킹 또는 증권사 앱을 스마트폰 내에서 확인한 후 응모하면 선착 순 500명에게 스타벅스 아이스 아메리카노 모바일 쿠폰을 지급할 예정이다.최근 국회에서 전자서명법 개정안이 통과되면서 패스 인증서를 비롯한 다양한 사설인증 서비스가 더욱 활성화될 것으로 기대되는 가운데, 국내 대형 은행 및 증권사 등 다수 금융기관에서는 이미 아톤의 PKI기술 기반 사설인증 솔루션을 2017년부터 도입하고 있다. 아톤이 통신3사와 공동으로 제공하고 있는 패스 인증서 서비스는 출시 1년만에 발급 건수 1300만 을 돌파했다. 패스 인증서는 별도 앱을 다운로드 받지 않고도 3초만에 발급이 가능하며, 실행 후 6자리 핀 번호 또는 생체인증으로 전자서명이 가능한 것이 특징이다. 인증서에 아톤의 시큐어 엘리먼트(SE) 기술을 적용해 외부 공격을 통한 정보 유출을 원천적으로 방지함으로써 보안 수준을 높였다.김종서 아톤 대표는 “핀테크 코리아 위크 박람회가 온라인으로 개최돼 장소 제약없이 접근이 용이한 만큼 국내외 다양한 기업들과 소통할 수 있을 것으로 기대한다”며 “이번 행사를 통해 아톤의 비대면 중심 인증 서비스 사례를 기업뿐만 아니라 대고객에 홍보해 더 많은 고객들이 아톤의 서비스를 사용할 수 있도록 혁신에 매진하겠다”고 말했다.이후섭 (dlgntjq@edaily.co.kr)네이버에서 ‘이데일리’ 구독하기▶청춘뉘우스~ 스냅타임▶＜ⓒ종합 경제정보 미디어 이데일리 - 무단전재 & 재배포 금지＞	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=105&oid=018&aid=0004650190

2020.02.17.	연합뉴스	(LEAD) finance ministry-policy report	(LEAD) S. Korea to draw up further measures to contain economic impact of coronavirus(ATTN: UPDATES with finance minister's remarks in first 5 paras; CHANGES photo)  By Kim Deok-hyun   SEJONG, Feb. 17 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's finance minister said Monday the government will draw up a package of comprehensive measures to preemptively contain the economic impact of the novel coronavirus, which is expected to threaten the fragile Chinese and global economies.   In a policy report to President Moon Jae-in, Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said the measures, including policy tools to support exports, consumption and investment, will be introduced by the end of this month.    Hong said the COVID-19 virus outbreak "has significantly contracted private investment, consumption and exports," citing daily data on sales at discount store chains and exports to China.    Hong called for people not to reduce their normal economic activities, saying excessive fear of the virus could hurt the economy.    On the financial markets, Hong said the government will swiftly take action to stabilize markets if volatility grows.   The nation's aviation, hotel and restaurant sectors are expected to take a harder hit from the spread of the virus, as a large proportion of visitors come from China.   Earlier this month, the ministry said it will provide 2 trillion won (US$1.7 billion) in financial support to small merchants who are expected to be hurt by the spread of the virus.    Also on Monday, the ministry said it provide 300 billion won in emergency loans to local budget carriers. Budget carriers will also be exempted from paying airport usage fees.   The government will set up a fund of 60 billion won to help support the nation's shipping industry.   South Korea has reported 30 confirmed cases of the virus so far, with nine patients having fully recovered from the illness.President Moon Jae-in (C) speaks at a Cheong Wa Dae session on this year's economic policy on Feb. 17, 2020. (Yonhap)With uncertainty lingering about the peak of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,700 people and infected 70,000, mostly in China, South Korea is stepping up efforts to minimize the economic impact of the disease.    Vice Finance Minister Kim Yong-beom told reporters that the ministry will mobilize policy banks and loans to aggressively contain the economic impact of the virus.    However, the government has not been considering an extra budget because of the difficulty of gauging how broadly the virus will spread, Kim said.    The economic impact of the virus could be assessed in late March, when economic indexes of February industrial activities will be announced, Kim said.    South Korea's economy grew 2 percent last year, its slowest growth in a decade. The nation's finance ministry has predicted the economy will grow 2.4 percent this year.   Hit by a trade war between the United States and China, South Korea's exports fell 10.3 percent on-year in 2019 to $542.4 billion.    Concerns are growing over South Korea's export performance down the road amid the coronavirus epidemic.    In the policy report, the ministry said it designated 10 industrial sectors for deregulation, including artificial intelligence and biotechnology, to help them develop technologies and services with fewer regulatory hurdles.    Other industrial sectors include mobility services, new medical technologies, biotechnology, fintech, tourism and e-commerce, it said.

2020.03.18.	서울경제	'亞 핀테크 허브' 되는 서울	서울핀테크랩, 출범 6개월만에 308억 투자유치서울 여의도 서울핀테크랩에서 스타트업 관계자들이 교육을 받고 있다./사진제공=서울시[서울경제] 서울시가 금융기술(FinTech·핀테크) 벤처기업 육성을 위해 야심차게 선보인 ‘서울핀테크랩’이 출범 6개월 만에 가시적인 성과를 거두고 있다. 올 들어서는 글로벌 시장에도 잇따라 진출하면서 미국 뉴욕과 영국 런던을 잇는 아시아 최대 핀테크 허브를 육성하겠다는 서울시의 계획에도 청신호가 켜졌다.서울시는 서울핀테크랩에 총 70개사 614명이 입주해 총 308억원의 투자를 유치했다고 18일 밝혔다. 전체 70개사 중 41개사는 276억원의 매출을 달성했고 36개사는 125명의 고용을 창출했다. 지급결제(21개사), 인공지능(10개사), P2P대출(7개사)를 포함해 최근 들어 플랫폼 노동자용 보험상품과 가계부채 경감 위한 대출전환 등 사업분야도 다양화하고 있다. 해외 진출에도 속도를 내고 있다. 서울핀테크랩 입주기업 70개사 중 39개사는 308억원의 국내외 투자유치에 성공했다. 17개사는 미국(4개사), 일본(4개사), 싱가포르(2개사), 베트남(5개사) 등 총 11개국에 진출하며 해외 공략을 가속화하고 있다. 서울핀테크랩은 서울시가 핀테크 벤처기업 육성을 위해 지난해 7월 서울 여의도에 개관했다. 같은 해 10월에는 기존 마포구에 있던 핀테크랩을 통합해 사업지원을 일원화했다. 현재 서울 영등포구 위워크 여의도역점 4개층을 사용 중이다.서울시는 서울핀테크랩 입주기업에 최대 2년 간의 입주공간을 제공한다. 핀테크 전문기업이 조기에 시장에 안착할 수 있도록 대기업 및 금융사 네트워킹, 전문가 멘토링, 국내외 투자 설명회 등을 체계적으로 지원한다. 각 벤처기업이 가장 필요로 하는 분야를 맞춤형으로 제공한다는 게 가장 큰 장점이다.서울시는 올해 ‘혁신성장펀드’를 서울핀테크랩 입주기업에 적용해 각 기업들의 애로사항이 규제 및 특허 관련 상담도 제공한다. 이를 위해 금융감독원과 특허청 등 유관기관과 협의해 현장상담소도 운영하고 있다. 올해는 서울핀테크랩 입주기업의 해외 진출을 앞당기기 위해 글로벌 사업화 프로그램을 확대해나갈 방침이다. 해외 우수 벤처기업 액셀러레이팅 프로그램과 연계하고 국내외 핀테크 관련 기관·대학과 협업 프로그램도 잇따라 선보일 계획이다.김의승 서울시 경제정책실장은 “올해는 서울핀테크랩 입주기업의 성장이 국내 핀테크 산업의 경쟁력으로 이어질 수 있도록 관계 기관 및 대학과의 협력을 강화할 방침”이라며 “앞으로도 글로벌 진출과 투자유치 성과를 극대화해 서울핀테크랩을 글로벌 핀테크 허브로 키워나가겠다”고 말했다. /이지성기자 engine@sedaily.com[서울경제 바로가기]▶ 새로워진 서울경제 모바일을 만나보세요.▶ 네이버 채널에서 '서울경제' 구독해주세요!저작권자 ⓒ 서울경제, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=011&aid=0003711331
2020.06.04.	연합뉴스	[PRNewswire] 무역 금융 핀테크 기업 Stenn, 핵심 금융 프로그램 확대	-- 새로운 주요 투자자 통해 5억 달러 규모로 확대(런던 2020년 6월 4일 PRNewswire=연합뉴스) 온라인 무역 금융 확장 기업 Stenn이 자사의 최신 투자 라운드에서 Barclays Bank, Coface SA 및 Crayhill Capital Management LP로부터 자금을 유치했다. 이번에 조성된 자금은 Stenn의 핵심 무역 금융 프로그램인 Stenn Assets Funding에 사용될 예정이다. 현재 Stenn Assets Funding의 규모는 5억 달러에 달한다. 수상 이력을 자랑하는 Stenn 금융 프로그램에 투자업체 두 곳과 보험사 한 곳이 합류했다. 기존 금융 투자자로는 이 프로그램을 주선한 Natixis, NN Investment Partners 및 M&G가 있다. 이번 투자는 국제 무역 금융 분야에서 Stenn의 지속적인 성장을 지원하며, International Financial Law Review로부터 받은 '올해의 유럽 구조적 금융 거래상 2020(European Structured Finance Deal of the Year 2020)'을 잇는 것이다. 코로나19 위기 속에서 기업을 지원하고자 한 달 사이 두 번째 자금 조달 라운드를 추진Stenn은 한 달도 채 되지 않은 기간에 이번 최신 투자 라운드를 포함해 두 차례의 투자 라운드를 진행했다. Stenn은 5월 11일 Crayhill을 통해 2억 달러 규모의 신규 프로그램을 완료한 바 있다. Crayhill은 뉴욕 기반의 민간 신용 관리업체이자 자산 기반 대출업체다. 이 투자 프로그램의 목적은 Stenn의 디지털 무역 금융 서비스를 확장하고, 국제 무역 흐름을 촉진하고자 하는 기업에 추가 지원을 제공하는 것이다. Stenn은 이번에 추가된 자금을 바탕으로 운전 자본이 위험할 정도로 부족한 이 시기에 신속하고 유연한 국제 무역 금융에 대한 접근성을 더 많은 기업에 제공할 수 있게 됐다. Stenn의 100% 디지털 금융은 국제 무역에서 독특한 형태2015년에 설립된 Stenn은 글로벌 공급망에서 구매자와 판매자를 위한 100% 디지털 금융을 제공하는 금융 기술 업체다. 최대 1,500만 달러가 온라인으로 조달 및 관리될 수 있으며, 요청 시 더 많은 금액이 이용 가능하다. 따라서 국제 거래를 위한 자본 접근성 속도가 극적으로 높아진다. Stenn은 다양한 산업에서 국제 무역을 지원하며, 국제상공회의소(International Chamber of Commerce)가 국제 무역 금융 분야에서 충족되지 못한 큰 수요라고 지칭한 1.5조 달러의 '무역 금융 간극'을 해소하는 데 일조한다. Stenn은 설립 후 크게 성장했으며, 현재 국제 무역 금융 분야의 선두 자리를 유지하고 있다. Stenn은 178개국의 수출업체에 자금을 지원하고 있으며, 더 많은 기업이 자금 조달 서비스를 이용하고, 사업 속도를 높일 수 있도록 지원한다.Stenn 설립자 Greg Karpovsky는 "코로나바이러스 팬더믹으로 인해 공급망이 붕괴 위기에 처했다"라며 "기업은 봉쇄를 헤쳐나가고자 비축된 유동성을 다 사용할 수밖에 없었고, 현재는 사업을 재활성화하기 위한 운전 자본이 필요한 시점"이라고 언급했다. 이어 그는 "이번에 유치한 투자는 자사가 지원하는 기업에 있어 중요한 시점에 성사된 것"이라면서 "질이 매우 높은 투자업체들이 이 프로그램의 확장에 참여했는데, 이는 국제 공급망에 유동성을 주입하고자 하는 자사의 전략적 비전을 확인해준 것이다. 최근에 발표한 Stenn Direct Funding 프로그램과 더불어, 자사는 고객이 국제 무역 흐름을 촉진하고, 세계적인 회복을 가속화 할 수 있도록 지원할 매우 좋은 입지를 점했다"라고 설명했다.Stenn 금융 및 자본 시장 글로벌 책임자 Chris Rigby는 "자사의 핵심 AR 자금 조달 프로그램을 증대 및 확장하게 돼 기쁘게 생각한다"라며 "코로나19 팬더믹으로 인해 최근 전 세계 자본 시장이 혼란을 겪고 있지만, 자사는 혁신적인 확장성 금융 구조를 개발과 함께 세계적 수준의 은행과 기관 투자자로부터 자본을 유치 및 보유할 역량도 증명했다"라고 말했다.Coface UK and Ireland 상무이사 Frederic Bourgeois는 "무역 금융에 대한 접근성이 전 세계 대부분의 경제에 중요한 이 시점에 Stenn International 및 다른 투자자와 더불어 Stenn의 새로운 개발 단계에 합류하게 된 것은 기쁜 일"이라면서 "이처럼 증가하는 수요는 자사가 지원하고자 하는 자금 조달 기회를 나타내는 것"이라고 강조했다.Natixis 구조적 신용 및 솔루션 부문의 글로벌 책임자 Emmanuel Issanchou는 "2018년부터 Stenn과 장기적으로 협력한 자사는 Stenn의 핵심적인 금융 프로그램 확장 및 증대를 지원하게 된 것에 자부심을 느낀다"라며 "현재 경제 여건은 그 어느 때보다 어렵다. Stenn의 상품과 서비스는 국제 거래 지원에 필요한 자금에 신속하게 접근할 수 있다는 분명한 이점을 제공한다"라고 말했다.편집자 주Stenn International Ltd. 소개    Stenn International Ltd.는 영국 기반의 데이터 및 금융 기업으로, 국제 무역에 종사하는 업체에 유연한 자금조달 서비스를 제공한다.

Stenn은 이와 같은 혁신적인 관행 덕분에 현재 국제 무역 부문에서 서비스가 부족한 여러 부문과 지역에서 자금조달 서비스를 제공하고 있다.Stenn은 부에노스아이레스, LA, 뉴욕, 마이애미, 런던, 암스테르담, 브뤼셀, 뒤셀도르프, 베를린, 뭄바이, 싱가포르, 홍콩, 광저우, 항저우, 칭다오 및 상하이 등 세계 여러 지역에서 사무소를 운영하고 있다.

The funding is for its core trade financing programme, Stenn Assets Funding, now sized at half a billion dollars.The two investors and the insurance provider have joined Stenn's award-winning financing programme, alongside existing financing providers Natixis, which is also the arranger of the programme, NN Investment Partners, and M&G. The investment supports Stenn's continued growth in the field of cross-border trade finance and comes on the back of the European Structured Finance Deal of the Year 2020 award from International Financial Law Review.Second funding round in one month to help companies during the Covid-19 crisis.The latest investment round is the second in less than a month for Stenn. The company closed a new $200 million programme on May 11 from Crayhill, a New York-based private credit manager and asset-based lender, in order to expand its digital trade finance services and further support companies in boosting their international trade flows. With this added capacity, Stenn is positioned to offer greater numbers of businesses access to fast and flexible cross-border trade finance at a time when working capital is critically scarce.Stenn's fully digital financing is unique in international trade.Founded in 2015, Stenn is a financial technology company that provides fully digital financing for buyers and sellers in global supply chains. Amounts up to $15 million may be funded and managed online, with larger amounts available on request, dramatically speeding up access to capital to fund cross-border transactions.The company supports international trade across a range of industries, helping to address the $1.5 trillion 'trade finance gap' identified by the International Chamber of Commerce as a significant unmet need in global trade financing.Stenn has grown significantly since launch, now residing as a top player in cross-border trade financing. The company's financing is available to exporters in 178 countries, allowing greater numbers of businesses to access financing and accelerate the rate at which they do business.Greg Karpovsky, Founder of Stenn, commented: "We're seeing supply chains at risk of breaking down due to the coronavirus pandemic.

KB국민카드 제공KB국민카드가 태국의 여신전문금융회사(여전사)를 인수한다. 국내 여전사가 태국 소비자금융 시장에 진출하는 건 이번이 처음이다.KB국민카드는 태국 여전사 제이 핀테크(J Fintech) 지분 인수를 위한 신주인수계약을 체결했다고 27일 밝혔다. 신용대출과 자동차 대출 등 소비자금융을 취급하는 제이 핀테크는 지난해 말 기준 총자산 1,516억원, 순이익 26억원을 기록한 태국 중견 여전사다. 총 인수대금은 248억원(6억5,000만 태국 바트)으로 KB국민카드는 제이 핀테크 의결권 지분 50.99%를 보유하게 된다. KB국민카드는 한국과 태국 금융당국의 승인절차와 인수 계약을 마무리한 뒤 이르면 올해 연말쯤 제이 핀테크를 공식 자회사로 편입할 계획이다.이번 계약은 이동철 KB국민카드 사장 취임 이후 캄보디아와 인도네시아에 이은 세 번째 해외 금융사 인수다. 태국 소비자금융 시장은 2018년 기준 약 410조원 규모로 최근 5년 평균 8%에 이르는 안정적인 성장세를 이어가고 있다는 게 KB국민카드 측 설명이다.KB국민카드 관계자는 “제이 핀테크를 10년 내 태국 최상위 소비자 금융회사로 도약시키겠다”고 밝혔다. 조아름 기자 archo1206@hankookilbo.com ▶네이버에서 한국일보 뉴스를 받아보세요 ▶뉴;잼을 보면 뉴스가 재밌다 [뉴스레터 구독하기] ▶한국일보닷컴 바로가기	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=469&aid=0000491280
2020.04.27.	디지털타임스	KB국민카드, 태국 소비자금융 시장 진출… 이동철號 해외사업 `가속도`	인수대금 248억원·의결권 지분 50.99%보유양국 승인절차 거쳐 연말께 자회사로 편입KB국민카드가 국내 여신전문금융회사 최초로 태국 소비자 금융시장에 진출한다. 이동철 KB국민카드 사장 부임 이후 진행된 캄보디아와 인도네시아에 이은 3번째 해외 금융회사 인수로, 올 초 신년사에서 언급한 동남아 국가를 중심으로 한 해외 사업의 확장 전략에도 가속도가 붙을 전망이다. 향후 KB국민은행 등 KB금융그룹 주요 계열사들의 태국 시장 진출에도 교두보 역할을 수행할 것으로 예상된다. 27일 여신업계 따르면 KB국민카드는 신용대출과 자동차대출 등 소비자 금융 사업을 영위하는 태국 여신전문금융회사 '제이 핀테크(J Fintech)' 지분 인수를 위한 '신주인수계약(SSA: Share Subscription Agreement)'를 맺었다고 밝혔다. KB국민카드의 총 인수 대금은 248억원(6억5000만바트)로, 제이 핀테크의 의결권 지분 50.99%를 보유하게 된다. 우리나라와 태국 금융 당국의 승인 절차와 인수 계약을 마무리하는 '딜 클로징(Deal Closing)' 등을 거쳐 이르면 연말께 공식 자회사로 편입된다.이번에 지분 인수 계약을 체결한 제이 핀테크는 태국 내 휴대전화 유통과 채권 추심 1위 업체를 계열사로 보유한 '제이마트(Jaymart)' 그룹의 금융 자회사이다. 지난 2011년 설립된 이 회사는 임직원 130여 명에 18개 영업소를 보유하고 있다. 지난해 말 기준 총자산 1516억원과 당기순이익 26억원을 기록한 여신전문금융회사이다.KB국민카드는 자회사 편입 후 본사의 지급 보증 등을 통한 자금 조달로 차입 비용 절감을 도모한다. 또 기존 보유 자산의 건전성을 높이는 등 우량 자산 중심의 포트폴리오 재편 작업을 진행한다. 영업 인프라 강화와 영업 채널 다각화를 위해 '제이마트' 그룹의 자회사인 '제이마트 모바일'이 보유한 전국 192개 매장을 '전속시장(Captive Market)'으로 활용한다. 이밖에 KB국민카드가 보유한 리스트 관련 핵심 역량도 현지에 이전해 정교한 자체 신용평가 모델을 개발하는 등 체계적인 리스크 관리를 도모한다.KB국민카드 관계자는 "이번 태국 시장 진출은 신용카드 등 금융 비즈니스 환경과 수요 그리고 현지 소비자 금융 시장의 지속적인 성장세 등을 종합적으로 고려해 장기적인 성장 가능성이 높고 전속 시장을 활용한 시너지 효과 창출이 가능한 현지 금융회사 인수를 위한 2년 여의 준비 작업이 결실을 맺게 된 것"이라고 밝혔다.황병서기자 BShwang@dt.co.kr27일 서울 종로구 KB국민카드 본사에서 온라인 화상 계약 방식으로 진행된 태국 여신전문금융회사'제이 핀테크(J Fintech)'지분 인수 계약식 후 이동철 KB국민카드 사장(왼쪽)이 아디삭 수쿰비타야(Adisak Sukumvitaya) '제이마트 그룹(Jaymart Group)' 회장과 기념 촬영을 하고 있다.

2020.05.22.	매경닷컴	현대차 시총 제친 카카오…질주 계속될까	美 대표기술주와 PER 비교22일도 4% 오르며 `파죽지세`톱10 다 빠지는데 네이버와↑시총 21.5조…LG생건에 육박PER 68배…구글의 두배이상130배인 아마존의 절반 수준이커머스 비중 커 언택트 수혜 카카오 시가총액이 22일 현대차를 앞질러 전체 상장사 가운데 9위에 올랐다. 카카오 시가총액은 최근 들어 현대차를 수차례 앞섰지만, 종가 기준으로 따돌린 것은 이번이 처음이다. 이날 카카오 주가는 전일 대비 4.0% 올라 24만7000원을 기록했다. 이 결과 카카오 시가총액은 21조5062억원을 기록했다. 삼성전자 우선주를 제외하면 전체 상장사 가운데 9번째다. 반면 이날 현대차 주가는 전일 대비 2.78% 떨어져 9만4500원에 장을 마쳤다. 현대차 시가총액은 이날 종가 기준으로 20조1916억원이다. 이날 카카오와 현대차 시가총액 차이는 1조3146억원에 달한다. 이날 네이버 주가 또한 전일 대비 2.44% 올라 23만500원을 기록했다. 네이버는 이날 시가총액 4위를 차지했는데, 3위 삼성바이오로직스와의 차이가 3조273억원에 그쳤다.한국 기술주가 이처럼 증시를 뒤흔든 배경에는 '언택트(비대면)' 확산이 결정적 역할을 했다. 한국과 미국 기술주 모두 '언택트' 수혜 사업의 비중이 클수록 주가수익비율(PER)이 높은 현상이 나타나고 있다. 카카오가 대표적인 사례다. 지난 1분기 카카오는 콘텐츠 부문 매출이 49.1%에 달했다. 음악, 게임은 물론 웹툰까지 다양한 사업을 통해 매출 4266억원을 거뒀다. 플랫폼 부문 매출은 50.9%였는데, '선물사기'나 '모빌리티' 등과 같은 다양한 신사업을 운영하고 있으며 광고 수익 비중은 크지 않다. 특히 최근 들어 '핀테크(Fintech)' 사업으로 영역을 넓히면서 성장성 또한 인정받고 있다. 이를 반영해 카카오의 올해 예상 PER는 68.0배에 달한다. 황승택 하나금융투자 연구원은 "바로투자증권 인수와 함께 증권사 라이선스를 확보한 뒤로 가입자 100만명을 이미 확보했다"면서 "공인인증서 폐지와 같은 긍정적인 이벤트도 있기 때문에 중·장기적 성장 추세는 더욱 견고해질 것"이라고 밝혔다. 네이버 또한 지난 1분기 비즈니스 플랫폼(전자상거래) 사업 매출 비중이 43.3%였다. 반면 같은 기간 광고 매출 비중은 8.3%에 그쳤다. 네이버는 올해 예상 PER가 39.4배를 기록하고 있다.'언택트' 확산에 따른 옥석 가리기는 미국 증시에서도 나타나고 있다. 전자상거래 매출 비중이 높을수록 주가 강세가 돋보이고, 광고 매출 비중이 높으면 힘을 못 쓰는 형국이다. '언택트' 확산으로 가장 큰 수혜를 입은 기업은 아마존이다. 아마존 주가는 최근 3개월 사이 16.7% 급등했다. 이 결과 올해 예상 실적으로 추산한 아마존 PER는 21일 기준 129.8배에 달한다. 아마존은 '언택트' 대장주로 꼽히며 올해 예상 실적보다 주가 수준이 높게 유지되고 있다. 지난해 말 아마존 PER는 80.3배였다. 코로나19 대유행 이후 주가 수준이 1.5배 급등했다.반면 광고 매출 비중이 높은 구글은 주가 상승이 제한적이다. 구글은 지난해 광고 매출 비중이 82.0%였다. 반면 콘텐츠 사업은 부진해 지난해 유튜브 매출 비중이 9.8%였다. 이를 반영해 구글 모회사 알파벳 보통주(A주) 주가는 지난 3개월 사이 5.2% 하락했다. 지난해 연간 기준으로 알파벳 보통주 PER는 27.9배였다. 올해 예상 실적으로 추산한 알파벳 보통주 PER 또한 33.9배에 그친다. 주가 수준이 코로나19 사태 이후 제자리걸음을 하고 있는 것이다.

Although the continued spread of coronavirus has disrupted many industries in South Korea, those related to “untact” services -- referring to no-contact interaction, which have become an integral part of life -- have fared well and are expected to grow even further, according to industry sources Wednesday. E-commerce companies appear to be the biggest beneficiaries of the prolonged pandemic. Online shopping transactions in Korea amounted to 11.9 trillion won ($9.7 billion) in February, up 24.5 percent from a year earlier, the largest increase in 16 months, according to Statistics Korea. Coupang has been doing particularly well, posting a 70 percent on-year growth of its monthly transactions at 1.63 trillion won in February.Kyobo Securities said the local e-commerce market is expected to maintain a high growth rate of 25 to 35 percent on-year until at least the second quarter. It cited a surge in online consumption in the past cases of H1N1 --- or swine flu -- pandemic of 2009 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2015. Payment gateway companies are also benefiting from the surge in online transactions. A payment gateway technology is used by merchants -- both brick-and-mortar retail stores and online stores -- to accept debit or credit card purchases from customers.　According to the Bank of Korea, the average daily use of simple payment services came to 6.02 million last year, up 56.6 percent from a year earlier. Simple payment services refer to any electronic payment service that allows users to make payments on and off-line simply and securely. The recent spread of COVID-19 has led to a surge in the number of simple payment users between February and March, according to the fintech industry. Korea’s leading payment service providers include NHN Korea Cyber Payment, NICE Information & Telecommunication and KG Inicis. NHN Korea Cyber Payment’s transactions in March surpassed 2 trillion won, the highest ever. Services related to teleworking have also fared well as many companies choose work from home to follow social distancing rules. Hyosung ITX introduced its new business, “smart contact center solution,” in December last year, which supports the telework of call centers. The service was currently supplied to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 1339 call center.Posco ICT, which has strengths in smart factories, cloud and security, is also expected to see an increase in demand for solutions as demand for non-face-to-face and remote areas increases in the wake of COVID-19, according to SK Securities. Even if the pandemic calms down, the emerging trend in online services will not quickly die down as no-contact services become part of our lives due to the prolonged coronavirus outbreak, according to industry watchers. “The prolonged coronavirus is bringing many changes to our lives and businesses. Among them, there is a temporary phenomenon, but in many cases, it is expected to form a new service trend in the economy and society,” said Yoo Seung-wha, an honorary professor at Ajou University.For example, the use of services, such as telework, telemedicine, remote video conferencing, online education, online company listing and online live marketing, is rapidly increasing, he noted. “In the long run, network upgrades and 5G investments will inevitably accelerate worldwide, as once-increased data usage tends not to shrink well. Cloud-based service platforms that can effectively deliver these new trends will also be the biggest real beneficiaries,” Yoo said. By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com)　[네이버에서 코리아헤럴드 구독]▶ KH Podcast     ▶ KH Video<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000217334

2020.02.26.	스포츠서울	암호화폐 시총 3위 리플, 한국시장 공략 가속화	제공 | 리플[스포츠서울 이상훈 기자] 블록체인 기반 해외 송금 서비스 선도 기업 리플(Ripple)이 국내 해외 송금 핀테크(fintech) 기업 센트비(Sentbe), 한패스(Hanpass), 와이어바알리(WireBarley)와 파트너십을 체결하며 한국 시장 공략을 본격화한다고 26일 밝혔다. 센트비는 일본과 중국, 필리핀, 인도네시아, 베트남 등 동남아시아 지역을 중심으로 해외 송금 서비스를 선도하는 기업 중 하나다. 센트비가 은행 및 결제 서비스 제공업체 등이 전세계 어디든 손쉽게 송금 가능하게 돕는 리플의 글로벌 결제 네트워크 ‘리플넷(RippleNet)’에 합류함으로써, 고객들은 ‘엔드 투 엔드(End-to-end)’ 추적을 통해 수 초 만에 송금 및 결제 할 수 있으며, 수수료, 송금 시간, 송금 진행 상황 등을 쉽게 파악 가능하다.센트비 최성욱 대표는 “국내에서 해외로, 특히 동남아시아로 송금되는 자금이 지난해부터 꾸준히 증가하고 있다”며 “단 몇 초 만에 송금이 완료되는 리플넷은 비통합 네트워크에 어려움을 느끼거나, 기존의 송금 과정을 신뢰하지 못하는 고객들에게 완전히 새로운 경험의 세계를 보여줄 뿐만 아니라 네트워크 확대로 국내 송금 유입액도 더욱 증가할 것”이라고 전했다.에릭 반 밀튼버그(Eric van Miltenberg) 리플 글로벌 운영 및 사업개발 부문 수석부사장은 “아시아·태평양 지역은 리플이 주목하는 매우 중요한 시장으로 리플넷을 통해 새로운 금융 기관 및 파트너들과 지속적으로 관계를 맺는데 주력하고 있다”며 “고객사의 절반이 아시아 지역에 있는 만큼 지속적으로 리플의 주요 모멘텀을 쌓아갈 것”이라고 말했다. 리플은 지난해 11월 기준, 전 세계 시장에 300개의 리플넷 고객을 확보했으며 수십 년의 송금 시스템 성장 경험을 갖추고 있다고 발표한 바 있다.◇ 코인원 트랜스퍼, 리플넷 활용 해외 송금 서비스 ‘크로스’ 출시리플은 이미 한국 내 금융 기관 및 소액 해외 송금 업체 등 리플넷 고객사를 보유하고 있다. 지난 2018년, 국내 최대 암호화폐 거래소 코인원(Coinone)의 자회사 ‘코인원 트랜스퍼(Coinone Transfer)’는 국내 최초 블록체인 기술 기반 해외 송금 애플리케이션 ‘크로스(Cross)’ 출시를 위해 리플넷에 가입한 바 있다. 크로스는 태국이나 필리핀 등과 같은 주변국 대상 송금 서비스를 빠른 속도와 낮은 수수료 등의 혜택으로 제공하는 애플리케이션이다. 코인원 트랜스퍼는 리플넷 사용 이후 월별 50% 증가된 송금액을 기록했으며, 수수료를 일반 은행보다 90% 줄였다. 지난 한 해 동안 리플은 전 세계 시장에서 전례 없는 성장을 이뤘다. 브라질과 아이슬란드, 두바이 등지에 사업을 확장했으며, 싱가포르 기반 임직원은 두 배 증가했다. 그리고 올해 한국과 일본, 싱가포르 등 아시아 태평양 지역 고객 확장에 주력할 예정이다.요시카와 에미(Emi Yoshikawa) 리플 글로벌 운영 책임자는 “한국은 핀테크 혁신으로 각광 받는 국가로서 리플 또한 고객 기반 입지를 키우고자 전념하는 곳이다”라며 “2017년 한국 정부가 소액 해외 송금업을 허용한 뒤부터 한국의 핀테크 업체들이 얼마나 빠르게 성장해왔는지 지켜봐왔기 때문에 그 혁신에 리플이 동참하게 돼 기쁘다”고 전했다.party@sportsseoul.com[기사제보 news@sportsseoul.com]  Copyright ⓒ 스포츠서울&sportsseoul.com	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=105&oid=468&aid=0000630740
2020.04.27.	디지털타임스	KB국민카드, 태국 소비자금융 시장 진출… 이동철號 해외사업 `가속도`	인수대금 248억원·의결권 지분 50.99%보유양국 승인절차 거쳐 연말께 자회사로 편입KB국민카드가 국내 여신전문금융회사 최초로 태국 소비자 금융시장에 진출한다. 이동철 KB국민카드 사장 부임 이후 진행된 캄보디아와 인도네시아에 이은 3번째 해외 금융회사 인수로, 올 초 신년사에서 언급한 동남아 국가를 중심으로 한 해외 사업의 확장 전략에도 가속도가 붙을 전망이다. 향후 KB국민은행 등 KB금융그룹 주요 계열사들의 태국 시장 진출에도 교두보 역할을 수행할 것으로 예상된다. 27일 여신업계 따르면 KB국민카드는 신용대출과 자동차대출 등 소비자 금융 사업을 영위하는 태국 여신전문금융회사 '제이 핀테크(J Fintech)' 지분 인수를 위한 '신주인수계약(SSA: Share Subscription Agreement)'를 맺었다고 밝혔다. KB국민카드의 총 인수 대금은 248억원(6억5000만바트)로, 제이 핀테크의 의결권 지분 50.99%를 보유하게 된다. 우리나라와 태국 금융 당국의 승인 절차와 인수 계약을 마무리하는 '딜 클로징(Deal Closing)' 등을 거쳐 이르면 연말께 공식 자회사로 편입된다.이번에 지분 인수 계약을 체결한 제이 핀테크는 태국 내 휴대전화 유통과 채권 추심 1위 업체를 계열사로 보유한 '제이마트(Jaymart)' 그룹의 금융 자회사이다. 지난 2011년 설립된 이 회사는 임직원 130여 명에 18개 영업소를 보유하고 있다. 지난해 말 기준 총자산 1516억원과 당기순이익 26억원을 기록한 여신전문금융회사이다.KB국민카드는 자회사 편입 후 본사의 지급 보증 등을 통한 자금 조달로 차입 비용 절감을 도모한다. 또 기존 보유 자산의 건전성을 높이는 등 우량 자산 중심의 포트폴리오 재편 작업을 진행한다. 영업 인프라 강화와 영업 채널 다각화를 위해 '제이마트' 그룹의 자회사인 '제이마트 모바일'이 보유한 전국 192개 매장을 '전속시장(Captive Market)'으로 활용한다. 이밖에 KB국민카드가 보유한 리스트 관련 핵심 역량도 현지에 이전해 정교한 자체 신용평가 모델을 개발하는 등 체계적인 리스크 관리를 도모한다.KB국민카드 관계자는 "이번 태국 시장 진출은 신용카드 등 금융 비즈니스 환경과 수요 그리고 현지 소비자 금융 시장의 지속적인 성장세 등을 종합적으로 고려해 장기적인 성장 가능성이 높고 전속 시장을 활용한 시너지 효과 창출이 가능한 현지 금융회사 인수를 위한 2년 여의 준비 작업이 결실을 맺게 된 것"이라고 밝혔다.황병서기자 BShwang@dt.co.kr27일 서울 종로구 KB국민카드 본사에서 온라인 화상 계약 방식으로 진행된 태국 여신전문금융회사'제이 핀테크(J Fintech)'지분 인수 계약식 후 이동철 KB국민카드 사장(왼쪽)이 아디삭 수쿰비타야(Adisak Sukumvitaya) '제이마트 그룹(Jaymart Group)' 회장과 기념 촬영을 하고 있다.

KB국민카드는 총 248억원(6억5000만바트)에 제이 핀테크 의결권 지분 50.99%를 인수한다. 이동철 사장이 올해 초 신년사를 통해 언급한 동남아시아 국가를 중심으로 한 해외 사업 지속 확장 전략이 이번 인수를 계기로 더욱 가속도가 붙을 것으로 예상된다고 KB국민카드는 강조했다. 향후 KB국민은행 등 KB금융그룹 주요 계열사들의 태국 시장 진출 교도부 역할을 수행할 것으로도 기대했다. 태국 소비자 금융 시장은 2018년 기준 410조원 규모다. 최근 5년 평균 8%씩 성장하고 있다. 신용카드 시장도 연평균 7% 이상 성장하고 있다. KB국민카드는 한국과 태국 금융 당국의 승인 절차와 인수 계약을 마무리하고 이르면 올해 연말 제이 핀테크를 공식 자회사로 편입할 계획이다. KB국민카드는 "현지 금융회사 인수를 위한 2년 여의 준비 작업이 결실을 맺게 됐다"며 "이번에 인수한 회사를 10년 내 태국 최상위 소비자 금융회사로 도약시키겠다"고 말했다. 김세관 기자 sone@▶줄리아 투자노트▶조 변호사의 가정상담소 ▶머니투데이 구독하기 <저작권자 ⓒ '돈이 보이는 리얼타임 뉴스' 머니투데이, 무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=008&aid=0004400517

2020.05.28.	edaily	8퍼센트, `코리아 핀테크 위크 2020` 참가…"모바일 기반 중금리대출 소개"	[이데일리 이후섭 기자] P2P 금융기업 8퍼센트는 28일부터 진행되는 `코리아 핀테크 위크 2020`에 참여해 모바일 기반 중금리 대출 서비스를 소개한다고 밝혔다. 코리아 핀테크 위크는 `핀테크를 통한 개방형 혁신(Fintech for Open Innovation)`을 주제로 금융위윈회가 글로벌 박람회로 개최하며, 코로나19 상황에 대응함과 동시에 산업 혁신 지속을 위해 온라인 기반 박람회로 전환해 핀테크 기업 및 금융회사의 디지털 컨텐츠를 게재한다. 8퍼센트는 핀테크 스케일업관에 참여해 중신용자에 특화된 P2P금융 서비스를 알린다. 온라인 참관객들에게는 가계 부채 경감을 위한 `이자 다이어트`에 대한 정보가 안내된다. 또 일반인보다 높은 수준의 금융 상식을 갖춘 전문투자자들을 통해 건전한 투자 문화가 선순환을 이루는 환경을 만들어 가기 위한 안내도 진행한다. 8퍼센트는 향후 전문투자자 그룹을 통해 투자자 책임원칙 구현과 투자자 보호장치 강화를 균형있게 구축해 갈 계획이다.2014년 11월 설립된 8퍼센트는 대출금과 상환금을 처리하는 금융 플랫폼을 운영 중이며 대출 채권, 금융 거래 등 코어 뱅킹 시스템을 구축했다. 또 8퍼센트는 금융정보가 부족한 씬파일러(Thin Filer)와 같이 기존 금융기관이 평가하지 못하는 중신용 등급 고객군에 대한 데이터를 집중적으로 축적하며 중금리 영역을 개척해왔다. 8퍼센트의 대표 서비스인 개인신용 대출 상품은 지난 5년간 124만 건의 대출 신청(약 24조원 규모)을 심사했고, 1개 채권당 500여 개의 정보를 활용한 신용평가모형을 활용 중이다. 해당 모형은 대출자의 일상 생활에 밀접한 관계를 지닌 비금융 정보를 추가로 활용한 머신러닝 평가 시스템을 진화시키며 중신용(신용등급 4~7등급) 고객에 대한 분별력을 꾸준히 상승시키고 있다.이효진 8퍼센트 대표는 “중신용자에 대한 데이터 수집이 가속화되고 유의미한 축적 기간이 경과하면서 신용 4~7등급 고객에 대한 분별력이 정교해지고 있다”며 “온라인투자연계금융업법과 함께 데이터 3법 등 핀테크 친화적인 환경이 조성된 것도 중금리 대출 활성화에 긍정적인 측면”이라고 말했다.이후섭 (dlgntjq@edaily.co.kr)네이버에서 ‘이데일리’ 구독하기▶청춘뉘우스~ 스냅타임▶＜ⓒ종합 경제정보 미디어 이데일리 - 무단전재 & 재배포 금지＞	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=105&oid=018&aid=0004650198
2020.02.06.	연합뉴스	한화금융 계열사, 디지털 시대에 맞는 새 성과관리체계 도입	한화금융네트워크[촬영 안철수]    (서울=연합뉴스) 구정모 기자 = 한화생명·한화손해보험·한화투자증권·한화자산운용 등 한화 금융계열사가 디지털 시대에 걸맞은 새로운 성과관리체계인 'OKR(Objective and Key Results)'을 도입한다고 6일 밝혔다.     OKR은 목표(Objective)와 핵심결과(Key results)의 약자로 기업과 팀, 혹은 개인이 협력해 목표를 세우는 경영도구이다.    짧게는 수 주, 길게는 분기 단위로 목표 관리가 가능해 대내외 환경에 민첩하게 대응할 수 있다는 장점이 있다.     기존의 성과관리지표인 KPI(Key Performance Indicator)는 연간 단위로, 하향식으로 목표가 수립된다.    한화 금융계열사들은 OKR의 안착을 위해 OKR 진척도를 수시로 모니터링할 수 있는 IT(정보기술) 시스템을 구축하고, 운영 전담조직과 코치를 양성하기로 했다.     한화 금융계열사 관계자는 "핀테크(FinTech)가 아닌 테크핀(TechFin)이라는 말이 나올 정도로 디지털 기술이 금융업 전반을 견인한다고 볼 수 있다"며 "이번 전사적 OKR 도입으로 새로운 환경에 유연하게 대응해 한화 금융계열사들의 디지털 전환이 가속화될 것"이라고 말했다.    pseudojm@yna.co.kr▶네이버 [연합뉴스] 채널 구독▶확 달라진 연합뉴스를 만나보세요   ▶뭐 하고 놀까? #흥	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=001&aid=0011382309
2020.02.06.	뉴스1	한화금융, 새 성과관리체계 OKR 도입…"디지털 전환 가속화"	기존 1년 단위 성과관리에서 최소 주 단위로 '빠르게'"급변하는 환경에 민첩∙유연하게 대응하기 위한 조직문화 장착"김승연 한화그룹 회장이 지난 2일 신년사를 하고 있다.(한화그룹 제공) © 뉴스1(서울=뉴스1) 민정혜 기자 = 한화생명, 한화손해보험, 한화투자증권, 한화자산운용으로 구성된 한화 금융계열사가 짧게는 주간, 길게는 분기 단위로 성과를 관리하는 새로운 성과관리체계 OKR(Objective and Key Results)을 도입한다고 6일 밝혔다. 한화 금융계열사는 대내외 환경에 민첩하게 대응해 디지털 전환을 가속화하겠다는 계획이다. OKR은 '어떤 방향으로 갈 것인가(Objective)'와 '그곳에 가고 있다는 것을 어떻게 알 수 있는지(Key results)'의 합성어다. OKR은 회사가 목표의 방향을 설정하면 부서와 직원이 자발적으로 짧은 단위의 전략을 세우는 방식이다. 부서와 직원들은 목표를 이룰 수 있는 핵심 결과 지표를 정하고, 단기 주요 활동 리스트를 만든다. 이후 결과 지표를 확인하며 성과를 평가하는 시스템이다.  OKR은 기존 연간 단위였던 성과관리지표인 KPI(Key Performance Indicator)에 비해 주기가 짧고, 부서와 직원의 자발성을 요구한다. 또 수치보단 전략 중심으로 무게 추가 옮겨간다.  OKR은 IT기업이나 스타트업에서 주요 사용된다. 구글, 유튜브, 페이스북 등 포춘 500대 글로벌 기업의 25%가 OKR을 적용하고 있다. 특히 40명의 소수 조직이었던 구글이 글로벌 기업으로 성장하는데 가장 결정적 요인인 것으로 알려져 있다. 국내 금융사에선 한화 금융계열사가 선제적으로 도입했다. 디지털 기반으로 재편되고 있는 금융환경에서 민첩하고 유연하게 대응할 수 있는 조직문화를 장착하기 위한 노력이다. 김승연 한화그룹 회장은 신년사에서 “전사 차원의 디지털 트랜스포메이션을 가속화해 4차 산업 혁명시대의 경쟁력을 적극 확보해야 한다"고 강조한 바 있다. 한화 금융계열사는 OKR 도입에 앞서 2019년부터 특정 업무 단위에 애자일(Agile) 업무 방식을 적용했다. OKR과 애자일(Agile) 조직의 시너지 효과로 불확실성이 높은 환경 변화에 빠르게 대응하겠다는 구상이다. 애자일은 '민첩한', '기민한'이란 뜻으로 부서 간 경계를 허물고 필요에 맞게 소규모 팀을 구성해 업무를 수행하는 조직문화를 말한다. 한화생명은 미래전략실, 기술전략실, 글로벌네트워크본부 등 미래 혁신을 추진하는 주요 본부를 애자일 조직으로 운영하고 있다. 한화투자증권도 작년 애자이혁신실을 신설했다. 한화 금융계열사는 OKR 도입에 발맞춰 애자일(Agile) 조직을 확대할 계획이다. 한화 금융계열사는 OKR 진척도를 수시로 모니터링 하는 IT 시스템을 각 사에 구축해 연착륙을 돕는다. 또 한화 금융계열사 차원에서 운영 전담조직과 코치를 양성하고, 중간 점검과 리뷰를 할 수 있는 협의체도 구성할 계획이다. 한화 금융계열사 관계자는 "핀테크(FinTech)가 아닌 테크핀(TechFin)이라는 말이 나올 정도로 디지털 기술이 금융업 전반을 견인한다"며 "이번 전사적 OKR 도입으로 새로운 환경에 유연하게 대응해 한화 금융계열사들의 디지털 트랜스포메이션이 가속화될 것으로 기대한다"고 밝혔다.mjh@news1.kr▶ [ 해피펫 ]  ▶ [터닝 포인트 2020] 구매!▶ 네이버 메인에서 [뉴스1] 구독하기![© 뉴스1코리아(news1.kr), 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=421&aid=0004447679
2020.02.06.	서울경제	한화 금융계열사, 구글式 성과평가체계 도입한다	김동원 한화생명 상무 진두지휘증권 등 전 계열사에 단계 도입애자일 조직 도입 따른 후속조치[서울경제] 한화(000880)금융 계열사가 연간 단위, 조직 중심의 성과관리체계인 핵심성과지표(KPI) 대신 구글·페이스북 등 디지털 기업의 단기·프로젝트 중심 성과체계인 ‘OKR(Objective and Key Results)’을 단계적으로 도입한다. 김승연 한화그룹 회장의 차남인 김동원(사진) 한화생명(088350) 상무가 최고디지털전략책임자(CDSO)로서 디지털 전환을 진두지휘하면서 금융 계열사 중심의 조직 혁신이 가속화하고 있다는 평가다. 한화생명·한화투자증권(003530) 등 한화 금융 계열사는 6일 지난해 애자일 조직 도입에 따른 후속 조치로 새로운 성과관리체계인 ‘OKR’을 도입한다고 밝혔다.애자일 조직이란 소규모 팀을 중심으로 업무를 수행하는 조직으로 정보기술(IT) 기업에서 널리 도입됐고 최근에는 금융권으로도 확대되면서 한화 금융 계열사도 지난해부터 특정 업무 단위에 애자일 방식을 도입했다.OKR은 애자일 조직에 적합한 성과관리체계로 매년 연말·연초 연간 목표를 설정하는 KPI 방식과 달리 주간·월간·분기 단위로 단기 목표를 설정해 민첩하고 유연하게 대응할 수 있다는 장점이 있다. 또 회사가 큰 틀의 목표를 설정하면, 각 부서와 직원이 자발적으로 목표를 설정하는 쌍방향 방식으로 톱다운(하향식) 방식의 KPI에 비해 자율성이 높고 목표 달성률도 높다.구글·유튜브·페이스북 등 포춘 500대 글로벌 기업의 25%가 OKR을 실행하고 있으며 특히 40명의 소수 조직이었던 구글이 글로벌 기업으로 성장하는 데 가장 결정적 요인으로 OKR이 꼽힌다.한화 금융 계열사는 올해부터 조직 단위 OKR을 수립해 적용하고 OKR의 진척도를 수시로 모니터링하는 IT 시스템도 구축하기로 했다. 또 운영 전담조직과 코치를 양성하고, 중간점검 및 리뷰를 할 수 있는 협의체도 마련할 계획이다.김승연 회장이 올해 신년사에서 전사 차원의 디지털 트랜스포메이션과 4차 산업혁명 시대의 경쟁력 확보를 강조한 만큼 김 상무를 중심으로 금융 계열사의 디지털 전환이 속도를 낼 것으로 전망된다.한화생명 관계자는 “핀테크(FinTech)가 아닌 테크핀(TechFin)이라는 말이 나올 정도로 디지털 기술이 금융업 전반을 견인하고 있다”며 “이번 전사적 OKR 도입으로 새로운 환경에 유연하게 대응해 디지털 전환을 가속화할 것”이라고 말했다./서은영기자 supia927@sedaily.com[서울경제 바로가기]▶ '한 눈에 쏙' 새로워진 서울경제 모바일 페이지를 만나보세요.

2020.02.06.	연합뉴스	한화금융 계열사, 디지털 시대에 맞는 새 성과관리체계 도입	한화금융네트워크[촬영 안철수]    (서울=연합뉴스) 구정모 기자 = 한화생명·한화손해보험·한화투자증권·한화자산운용 등 한화 금융계열사가 디지털 시대에 걸맞은 새로운 성과관리체계인 'OKR(Objective and Key Results)'을 도입한다고 6일 밝혔다.     OKR은 목표(Objective)와 핵심결과(Key results)의 약자로 기업과 팀, 혹은 개인이 협력해 목표를 세우는 경영도구이다.    짧게는 수 주, 길게는 분기 단위로 목표 관리가 가능해 대내외 환경에 민첩하게 대응할 수 있다는 장점이 있다.     기존의 성과관리지표인 KPI(Key Performance Indicator)는 연간 단위로, 하향식으로 목표가 수립된다.    한화 금융계열사들은 OKR의 안착을 위해 OKR 진척도를 수시로 모니터링할 수 있는 IT(정보기술) 시스템을 구축하고, 운영 전담조직과 코치를 양성하기로 했다.     한화 금융계열사 관계자는 "핀테크(FinTech)가 아닌 테크핀(TechFin)이라는 말이 나올 정도로 디지털 기술이 금융업 전반을 견인한다고 볼 수 있다"며 "이번 전사적 OKR 도입으로 새로운 환경에 유연하게 대응해 한화 금융계열사들의 디지털 전환이 가속화될 것"이라고 말했다.    pseudojm@yna.co.kr▶네이버 [연합뉴스] 채널 구독▶확 달라진 연합뉴스를 만나보세요   ▶뭐 하고 놀까? #흥	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=001&aid=0011382309
2020.02.06.	뉴스1	한화금융, 새 성과관리체계 OKR 도입…"디지털 전환 가속화"	기존 1년 단위 성과관리에서 최소 주 단위로 '빠르게'"급변하는 환경에 민첩∙유연하게 대응하기 위한 조직문화 장착"김승연 한화그룹 회장이 지난 2일 신년사를 하고 있다.(한화그룹 제공) © 뉴스1(서울=뉴스1) 민정혜 기자 = 한화생명, 한화손해보험, 한화투자증권, 한화자산운용으로 구성된 한화 금융계열사가 짧게는 주간, 길게는 분기 단위로 성과를 관리하는 새로운 성과관리체계 OKR(Objective and Key Results)을 도입한다고 6일 밝혔다. 한화 금융계열사는 대내외 환경에 민첩하게 대응해 디지털 전환을 가속화하겠다는 계획이다. OKR은 '어떤 방향으로 갈 것인가(Objective)'와 '그곳에 가고 있다는 것을 어떻게 알 수 있는지(Key results)'의 합성어다. OKR은 회사가 목표의 방향을 설정하면 부서와 직원이 자발적으로 짧은 단위의 전략을 세우는 방식이다. 부서와 직원들은 목표를 이룰 수 있는 핵심 결과 지표를 정하고, 단기 주요 활동 리스트를 만든다. 이후 결과 지표를 확인하며 성과를 평가하는 시스템이다.  OKR은 기존 연간 단위였던 성과관리지표인 KPI(Key Performance Indicator)에 비해 주기가 짧고, 부서와 직원의 자발성을 요구한다. 또 수치보단 전략 중심으로 무게 추가 옮겨간다.  OKR은 IT기업이나 스타트업에서 주요 사용된다. 구글, 유튜브, 페이스북 등 포춘 500대 글로벌 기업의 25%가 OKR을 적용하고 있다. 특히 40명의 소수 조직이었던 구글이 글로벌 기업으로 성장하는데 가장 결정적 요인인 것으로 알려져 있다. 국내 금융사에선 한화 금융계열사가 선제적으로 도입했다. 디지털 기반으로 재편되고 있는 금융환경에서 민첩하고 유연하게 대응할 수 있는 조직문화를 장착하기 위한 노력이다. 김승연 한화그룹 회장은 신년사에서 “전사 차원의 디지털 트랜스포메이션을 가속화해 4차 산업 혁명시대의 경쟁력을 적극 확보해야 한다"고 강조한 바 있다. 한화 금융계열사는 OKR 도입에 앞서 2019년부터 특정 업무 단위에 애자일(Agile) 업무 방식을 적용했다. OKR과 애자일(Agile) 조직의 시너지 효과로 불확실성이 높은 환경 변화에 빠르게 대응하겠다는 구상이다. 애자일은 '민첩한', '기민한'이란 뜻으로 부서 간 경계를 허물고 필요에 맞게 소규모 팀을 구성해 업무를 수행하는 조직문화를 말한다. 한화생명은 미래전략실, 기술전략실, 글로벌네트워크본부 등 미래 혁신을 추진하는 주요 본부를 애자일 조직으로 운영하고 있다. 한화투자증권도 작년 애자이혁신실을 신설했다. 한화 금융계열사는 OKR 도입에 발맞춰 애자일(Agile) 조직을 확대할 계획이다. 한화 금융계열사는 OKR 진척도를 수시로 모니터링 하는 IT 시스템을 각 사에 구축해 연착륙을 돕는다. 또 한화 금융계열사 차원에서 운영 전담조직과 코치를 양성하고, 중간 점검과 리뷰를 할 수 있는 협의체도 구성할 계획이다. 한화 금융계열사 관계자는 "핀테크(FinTech)가 아닌 테크핀(TechFin)이라는 말이 나올 정도로 디지털 기술이 금융업 전반을 견인한다"며 "이번 전사적 OKR 도입으로 새로운 환경에 유연하게 대응해 한화 금융계열사들의 디지털 트랜스포메이션이 가속화될 것으로 기대한다"고 밝혔다.mjh@news1.kr▶ [ 해피펫 ]  ▶ [터닝 포인트 2020] 구매!▶ 네이버 메인에서 [뉴스1] 구독하기![© 뉴스1코리아(news1.kr), 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=421&aid=0004447679
2020.02.06.	서울경제	한화 금융계열사, 구글式 성과평가체계 도입한다	김동원 한화생명 상무 진두지휘증권 등 전 계열사에 단계 도입애자일 조직 도입 따른 후속조치[서울경제] 한화(000880)금융 계열사가 연간 단위, 조직 중심의 성과관리체계인 핵심성과지표(KPI) 대신 구글·페이스북 등 디지털 기업의 단기·프로젝트 중심 성과체계인 ‘OKR(Objective and Key Results)’을 단계적으로 도입한다. 김승연 한화그룹 회장의 차남인 김동원(사진) 한화생명(088350) 상무가 최고디지털전략책임자(CDSO)로서 디지털 전환을 진두지휘하면서 금융 계열사 중심의 조직 혁신이 가속화하고 있다는 평가다. 한화생명·한화투자증권(003530) 등 한화 금융 계열사는 6일 지난해 애자일 조직 도입에 따른 후속 조치로 새로운 성과관리체계인 ‘OKR’을 도입한다고 밝혔다.애자일 조직이란 소규모 팀을 중심으로 업무를 수행하는 조직으로 정보기술(IT) 기업에서 널리 도입됐고 최근에는 금융권으로도 확대되면서 한화 금융 계열사도 지난해부터 특정 업무 단위에 애자일 방식을 도입했다.OKR은 애자일 조직에 적합한 성과관리체계로 매년 연말·연초 연간 목표를 설정하는 KPI 방식과 달리 주간·월간·분기 단위로 단기 목표를 설정해 민첩하고 유연하게 대응할 수 있다는 장점이 있다. 또 회사가 큰 틀의 목표를 설정하면, 각 부서와 직원이 자발적으로 목표를 설정하는 쌍방향 방식으로 톱다운(하향식) 방식의 KPI에 비해 자율성이 높고 목표 달성률도 높다.구글·유튜브·페이스북 등 포춘 500대 글로벌 기업의 25%가 OKR을 실행하고 있으며 특히 40명의 소수 조직이었던 구글이 글로벌 기업으로 성장하는 데 가장 결정적 요인으로 OKR이 꼽힌다.한화 금융 계열사는 올해부터 조직 단위 OKR을 수립해 적용하고 OKR의 진척도를 수시로 모니터링하는 IT 시스템도 구축하기로 했다. 또 운영 전담조직과 코치를 양성하고, 중간점검 및 리뷰를 할 수 있는 협의체도 마련할 계획이다.김승연 회장이 올해 신년사에서 전사 차원의 디지털 트랜스포메이션과 4차 산업혁명 시대의 경쟁력 확보를 강조한 만큼 김 상무를 중심으로 금융 계열사의 디지털 전환이 속도를 낼 것으로 전망된다.한화생명 관계자는 “핀테크(FinTech)가 아닌 테크핀(TechFin)이라는 말이 나올 정도로 디지털 기술이 금융업 전반을 견인하고 있다”며 “이번 전사적 OKR 도입으로 새로운 환경에 유연하게 대응해 디지털 전환을 가속화할 것”이라고 말했다./서은영기자 supia927@sedaily.com[서울경제 바로가기]▶ '한 눈에 쏙' 새로워진 서울경제 모바일 페이지를 만나보세요.

2020.03.31.	매경닷컴	Korean startups hard up amid virus outbreak, but excluded from state funding	South Korean startups including fintech companies are also under financial squeeze but have had less attention from lenders and state relief for economic fallouts from virus outbreak.According to a survey on 63 startups by the Banks Foundation for Young Entrepreneurs D.CAMP, seven out of 10 fintech, logistics and telecommunications companies are having trouble in fund raising. D.CAMP is a non-profit foundation built in 2012 by 18 financial institutions with investment of 845 billion won ($692 million) for vitalizing the Korean startup ecosystem, nurturing early-stage startups, and creating jobs for the younger generation. The biggest hurdle to fund-raising was deterioration in financial statements (39 percent), delay in meeting/discussion with investors (27 percent), delay in investment process by investors (18 percent), and different views on corporate value (9 percent). More than two-thirds of the respondents expected a fall in annual sales this year if the current coronavirus pandemic lasts longer than expected. About 30 percent of them forecast a 10-30 percent on-year drop in sales, and 26 percent a plunge of more than 30 percent. Investment in startups sharply declined in March. According to startup investment database The VC, the country’s investment in startups and venture companies totaled 190 billion won in March, plunging from 320 billion won in January and 340 billion won in February. Industry leaders now voice the need for the government’s active support tailored to startup companies.  Only 11 (17 percent) of the respondents answered they have been or are expected to be offered a slew of emergency funds or loans from the government, which have been recently announced to combat the economic fallouts from the COVID-19 crisis, in the survey. Others did not apply for the support due to disqualification (37 percent), slow and complicated process (22 percent), and lack of required policy (18 percent). Earlier, Seoul announced a 58.3 trillion won worth virus relief package to help small- and mid-sized companies, merchants and self-employed people who have been hit hard by the COVID-19 outbreak. Startups struggling to survive with financing or fledgling firms, however, are not included in the list of beneficiaries as it is hard to prove their sales. In response to the challenges, the majority of the respondents – 68 percent – asked for expanded financial aid and incentives. Others urged actions to boost investment (13 percent), and tax relief measures for businesses (11 percent). “I hope the government can expand emergency loans to include more startups as overall investor sentiment has turned sour,” said an unnamed industry leader. “Venture investment in Korea have risen for years, but whether the businesses actually feel the effect is questionable,” added another industry leader.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=009&aid=0004547763
2020.03.18.	연합뉴스	financial approval-Toss	Fintech firm Viva Republica wins preliminary approval for brokerage businessBy Kim Kwang-tae   SEOUL, March 18 (Yonhap) -- Viva Republica, the operator of popular South Korean financial service app Toss, said Wednesday its affiliate won preliminary approval for a brokerage business, a move that could further fuel competition in the securities industry.   Toss Preliminary Co., which is wholly owned by Viva Republica, needs to win formal approval for its online brokerage business from the Financial Services Commission.   Toss Preliminary is set to change its name to Toss Securities Co. before launching its brokerage business later this year, according to Kylie Yoon, a spokesperson for Viva Republica.The latest move came three months after Viva Republica and its consortium won preliminary approval for a new internet-only bank.   Toss Bank is expected to begin operation soon after gaining final approval for the license in the first half of 2021, according to Viva Republica.   In 2017, two internet-only banks -- K-Bank and Kakao Bank -- began to offer their services around the clock without face-to-face contact with customers and without brick-and-mortar branches.   Internet-only banks have gained popularity among mobile-savvy customers in recent years, as they offer great convenience to many bank customers who don't have the time to visit lenders during work hours.   Toss provides over 40 financial services including money transfers, financial dashboard, credit score management and payments. Toss has more than 16 million registered users in a country with a population of 51 million.   entropy@yna.co.kr(END)	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=001&aid=0011482444

Toss Bank is expected to begin operation soon after gaining final approval for the license in the first half of 2021, according to Viva Republica.   In 2017, two internet-only banks -- K-Bank and Kakao Bank -- began to offer their services around the clock without face-to-face contact with customers and without brick-and-mortar branches.   Internet-only banks have gained popularity among mobile-savvy customers in recent years, as they offer great convenience to many bank customers who don't have the time to visit lenders during work hours.   Toss provides over 40 financial services including money transfers, financial dashboard, credit score management and payments. Toss has more than 16 million registered users in a country with a population of 51 million.   entropy@yna.co.kr(END)	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=001&aid=0011482444
2020.05.18.	코리아헤럴드	Banking groups add momentum to digital financing amid coronavirus fallout	Woori Financial Group Chairman Son Tae-seung (center, rear row) poses for a photo with executives and employees after celebrating the launch of a digital innovation committee at its headquarters in Seoul on March 15.(Woori Financial Group)Reacting to the untact market trend triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak, South Korea’s financial groups are scrambling to gain an upper hand in digital financing.Untact, or non-face-to-face, has become a new standard in the local financial industry as consumers are increasingly turning to contactless financial services via smartphones amid fears of the ongoing COVID-19 or other plausible contagious diseases in the future.While the number of visitors to local bank branches decreased by nearly 40 percent in February from a year earlier, online cash transfers rose by 13.4 percent during the same period, industry sources said. Woori Financial Group, under the leadership of Chairman Sohn Tae-seung, was the pioneer in this responsive move.Under the new management slogan “Digital First, Change Everything” for the post-coronavirus era, Woori Financial launched a digital innovation committee, a control tower led directly by Chairman Sohn and Woori Bank President Kwon Kwang-seok, officials said Sunday. “The untact trend has now grown beyond just a temporary trend and become a new normal. Now is the golden time for digital innovation in the finance sector,” said the Woori chief.The committee will push ahead with various digital innovation projects -- ranging from the acquisition of fintech companies and digital collaboration with other industries. It also established the so-called “BLUE Team” within the group, whereby young and innovative employees create new strategies in line with changing digital trends.Shinhan Financial Group also recently held a lengthy debate on digital transformation under Chairman Cho Yong-byoung and 200 employees from its subsidiaries, adding weight to its digital drive.Hana Financial group is currently working on setting up a digital insurance platform through its newly-acquired affiliate, The-K NON-Life Insurance.Woori Financial Group Chairman Son Tae-seung (center, rear row) poses for a photo with executives and employees after celebrating the launch of a digital innovation committee at its headquarters in Seoul on March 15.(Woori Financial Group)Among regional financial institutions, JB Financial Group -- the holding group of Jeonbuk and Kwangju banks -- has launched Digital Community, a study group for leader-level employees to analyze digital financial ecosystems worldwide, officials said.By Choi Jae-hee (cjh@heraldcorp.com)[네이버에서 코리아헤럴드 구독]▶ KH Podcast     ▶ KH Video<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000218268
2020.05.26.	디지털데일리	Samsung Elevates Data Protection for Mobile Devices with New Security Chip Solution	- The new EAL 6+ certified-SE chip and dedicated software is a standalone security solution for mobile devices and other applications   By Yun Sang-ho   crow@ddaily.co.kr   [Digital Daily]   Seoul, Korea, May 26, 2020- Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., a world leader in advanced semiconductor technology, today introduced a standalone turnkey security solution comprised of a Secure Element (SE) chip (S3FV9RR) and enhanced security software that offers protection for tasks such as booting, isolated storage, mobile payment and other applications. The latest security chip is Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level (CC EAL) 6+ certified, the highest level acquired by a mobile component.   “In this era of mobility and contact-less interactions, we expect our connected devices, such as smartphones or tablets, to be highly secure so as to protect personal data and enable fintech activities such as mobile banking, stock trading and cryptocurrency transactions,” said Dongho Shin, senior vice president of System LSI marketing at Samsung Electronics. “With the new standalone security element solution (S3FV9RR), Samsung is mounting a powerful deadbolt on smart devices to safeguard private information.”    Samsung’s new security solution is an enhanced turnkey that follows the first-generation solution (S3K250AF) announced in February. The new security solution is a state-of-the-art component that offers higher assurance levels than its predecessor’s CC EAL 5+ with an industry-leading CC EAL 6+ certified-hardware secure element, S3FV9RR, and powerful security software. CC EAL 6+ is utilized in applications that demand the most stringent security requirements in the market such as flagship smartphones, e-passports and hardware wallets for cryptocurrency.   With twice the secure storage capacity, the new security solution also supports hardware-based root of trust (RoT), secure boot and device authentication that brings mobile security to the next level. Especially for service providers, manufacturers and organizations, secure device authentication is enhanced with the RoT when running proprietary applications on a mobile device. As a bootloader initiates, a chain of trust is activated through which each and every firmware with approved keys is sequentially validated. This secure booting process is handled by the RoT, guarding the device against any possible malicious attacks or unauthorized software updates.    As a standalone solution, the new security solution can work independently from the security performance of the device’s main processor. This makes the solution extremely versatile, expanding the security capabilities of mobile devices, IoT applications, and other devices in all performance levels. In addition, manufacturers can be assured that devices produced at an off-site location are not tainted with non-authorized firmware. The solution also meets the hardware security module requirements for cryptographic operations outlined by an upcoming mobile operating system version.    Samsung’s new security solution, S3FV9RR, is expected to be available within the third quarter of this year.뉴스채널 설정 - 네이버 메인에서 디지털데일리 뉴스를 볼 수 있어요.IT정보의 즐거운 업그레이드[딜라이트닷넷]<저작권자 © 디지털데일리 무단전재-재배포금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=105&oid=138&aid=0002086518
2020.06.09.	매경닷컴	[레이더M] 수피, 잇단 ICT투자 주목…쌍용정보 인수완료	지분 40% 274억원에 인수…위니아딤채·슈마커 등에도 투자[본 기사는 06월 08일(13:50) '레이더M'에 보도 된 기사입니다]사모펀드(PEF) 운용사 수앤파이낸셜인베스트먼트(수피)가 국내 최초 시스템통합(SI) 업체인 쌍용정보통신 인수를 마무리했다.8일 수피는 수피아이티센홀딩스가 쌍용정보통신의 경영권 인수를 위한 잔금 지급을 완료했다고 밝혔다. 수피아이티센홀딩스는 수피가 아이티센그룹과의 컨소시엄을 통해 설립한 사모투자 합자회사다. 지난 2월 이 컨소시엄은 한앤컴퍼니의 쌍용정보통신 지분 40%를 274억원에 인수하는 주식양수도계약을 체결한 바 있다. 주식매매계약(SPA) 체결 직후 터진 코로나19 사태가 장기화되면서 시장에선 이번 딜의 종결에 대한 우려도 제기됐지만 수피는 이번 잔금 지급을 통해 투자를 완결시켰다.시스템통합 업체인 쌍용정보통신은 1981년 설립됐으며 쌍용양회 계열사로 출발했다. 한앤컴퍼니는 쌍용양회를 인수한 뒤 쌍용정보통신을 계열 분리했고 지난해 말부터 지분 매각을 위해 잠재 매수자와 물밑에서 접촉해 온 것으로 알려졌다.수피는 쌍용정보통신 인수를 통해 그간 구축해온 정보통신기술(ICT) 기업 투자 포트폴리오 기업들의 시너지를 증대시킨다는 계획이다. 또 코로나19로 인한 비대면 산업의 성장과 한국판 뉴딜 정책에 맞춘 투자를 진행해 포트폴리오를 더욱 강화할 예정이다. 수피는 지난해에도 홍콩 소재 핀테크 업체인 TNG Fintech Group에 투자하고, 클라우드 인프라·인공지능(AI) 빅데이터 솔루션 업체인 소프트센 경영권 지분 인수를 마무리했다. 또 콤텍정보통신과 소프트아이텍 지분 인수도 완료했다.김철중 수피 대표는 ＂소프트센 인수에 이어 이번 쌍용정보통신 인수는 아이티센과의 전략적 파트너십을 맺음과 동시에, ICT 분야를 중심으로 국내외 투자를 집중적으로 진행해 인수회사 간의 시너지를 극대화하는 것이 주된 전략＂이라고 밝혔다.수앤파이낸셜인베스트먼트는 김철중 대표가 지난 2016년 설립한 업체로 이듬해 위니아딤채 2대주주 지분투자를 시작으로 슈마커, 소프트아이텍, 압타머사이언스, 매직마이크로 등에도 투자한 바 있다.

2020.03.13.	매경닷컴	Viva Republica gets preliminary approval for mobile brokerage service(토스 증권사 설립 박차…증선위 예비인가안 의결)	[Pulse로 배우는 영작문-799]'Pulse로 배우는 영작문'으로 영문 뉴스 읽기에 도전해보세요. [영문뉴스 원문 바로가기]  간편송금 서비스 '토스'를 운영하는 비바리퍼블리카가 신청한 증권사 설립 예비 인가안이 의결되면서 카카오페이 증권에 이어 두 번째 핀테크 증권사 설립에 속도가 붙게 됐다.  Viva Republica, the operator of South Korea’s peer-to-peer money transfer app Toss, has passed the government’s review process for its entry into the mobile securities business, moving closer to become the country’s second fintech company offering mobile platform-based brokerage services after Kakao Pay.금융위원회 산하 증권선물위원회는 11일 정례회의에서 비바리퍼블리카가 신청한 증권사 설립 예비 인가안을 상정해 의결했다. The Securities & Futures Commission under the Financial Services Commission (FSC) on Wednesday gave a preliminary nod to Viva Republica to provide investment brokerage services online.비바리퍼블리카는 지난해 6월 예비 인가를 신청했지만 금융감독원 심사 과정에서 관련 절차가 중단됐다. 자본 구조의 불안정성이 문제가 됐다. 비바리퍼블리카는 이를 해결하기 위해 지난해 11월 임시주주총회를 열고 기존에 발행된 상환전환우선주 전량을 전환우선주로 전환하기로 결정했다. 이는 대주주 자본 안정성을 더욱 강화하는 조치로 금감원은 이후 심사를 재개했다.Viva Republica filed for the government review in June last year, but the process has been delayed due to concerns about its funding capability. To smarten up its capital base, the company in November converted all of its redeemable convertible preference shares perceived as debt under International Financial Reporting Standards into convertible preferred stocks.금융위의 심의와 의결 이후에도 6개월 안에 다시 물적·인적 설비를 갖춰 본인가를 신청해야 하고 본인가까지 받으면 증권업을 시작할 수 있다. 비바리퍼블리카가 증권사를 설립하면 올해 들어 바로투자증권을 인수해 증권업에 진출한 카카오페이 증권에 이어 두 번째 핀테크 증권사가 탄생한다.Viva Republica is expected to file for final approval from the financial regulator after six months of preparation. Once approved, it would be the second fintech name to offer online brokerage services after Kakao Pay.앞서 금융위는 먼저 지난해 12월 한국토스은행(토스뱅크)이 신청한 인터넷전문은행 사업 예비 인가를 내줬다.Separately, the FSC gave a preliminary approval to Toss Bank to operate as an online-only bank in December.

2020.05.20.	매경닷컴	핀테크株 "전자서명 얼씨구"…주류株 "소·맥 배달 지화자"	공인인증서 폐지에 관련주 들썩보안·생체인증 업체 관심 집중한국전자인증 20일 상한가 강세라온시큐어도 3월比 주가 4배로배달 허용한 규제 개선안 반색주가오르며 실적개선 기대감도하이트진로 올 영업익 2배전망롯데칠성 주가 한달 새 39%↑◆ '열 지원책 안부러운 규제완화' 수혜주 2題 ◆  국회가 20일 공인인증서 폐지를 골자로 한 '전자서명법 개정안'을 처리하기로 하면서 핀테크(Fintech) 업체 주가가 들썩이고 있다. 또 정부가 최근 '주류 규제 개선 방안'을 발표해 음식점의 생맥주 배달을 허용하고 병·캔맥주와 소주 또한 주류 가격이 음식 가격보다 낮으면 배달 판매할 수 있도록 했다. 수입산 주류에 밀려 고전하던 국내 주류업체에 화색이 돌고 있다. 이처럼 '대못 규제'를 없애는 게 때로는 수천억 원의 정부 지원금보다 효과적이다. 코로나19 대유행으로 최악의 시기를 보내고 있는 국내 기업에 무엇이 필요한지 증시는 보여주고 있다.불필요한 규제의 대명사로 꼽혀온 공인인증서가 21년 만에 폐지 절차를 밟으면서 각종 인증 관련 기업 주가가 들썩이고 있다. 20대 국회 마지막 본회의에서 '전자서명법 전부개정안'을 통과 시키면서 민간 전자서명 방식을 폭넓게 선택할 수 있게 되고 인증산업도 활기를 띨 것으로 보인다.20일 한국거래소에 따르면 라온시큐어, 한국정보인증, 드림시큐리티 등 전자인증 관련주들은 이날 일제히 오름세로 장을 마감했다. 논란이 끊이지 않았던 공인인증서는 1999년 도입됐다. 일종의 '전자신분증'으로 프로그램 설치와 인증 절차가 복잡하고 시간이 오래 걸려 불편하다는 지적이 계속됐다. 라온시큐어는 전일 대비 9.13% 오른 4365원에 장을 마감했다. 보안솔루션 업체인 라온시큐어는 암호인증, PC 보안, 모바일 보안 분야에 특화된 기술을 갖고 있다. 신한은행, NH농협은행 등 70여 곳에 서비스를 공급하고 있으며 생체 인증 및 블록체인 기반 기술로 시장 범위를 확대해 나갈 예정이다. 주가는 최근 좋은 흐름을 보이며 19일 52주 신고가(4785원)를 기록하기도 했다. 저가를 기록했던 3월 20일 대비 4배 가까이 오른 수치다.  시장의 기대를 등에 업고 한국전자인증 주가 역시 이날 크게 올랐다. 한국전자인증은 모바일인증서비스와 기기인증서비스를 성장동력 사업으로 삼고 있다. 공공섹터뿐만 아니라 민간 분야의 전자입찰, 전자민원서비스, 전자세금계산서용 인증서 등 다양한 분야의 인증서를 발급하고 있다. 이날 주가는 가격 상한선에 육박한 29.02% 오른 7470원에 장을 마감했다. 3거래일 연속 오르면서 이날 52주 신고가(7520원)를 경신했다. 또 다른 보안인증 기업 드림시큐리티는 이날 4.09% 오른 3310원에 장을 마쳤다. 국내 1위 범용 공인인증 서비스 업체인 한국정보인증 역시 이날 장중 주가가 6150원을 기록하며 또다시 신고가를 경신했다. 5거래일 연속 상승세다. 18일에는 가격 제한 폭인 30%까지 오르며 주가가 급등하는 모습을 보였다. 한국정보인증은 삼성페이 본인 인증 서비스를 제공하는 회사다.생체 인증 전문기업 슈프리마에 대한 관심도 높다. 특히 외국인이 4~18일 7일 연속 이 종목을 순매수하는 등 시장 기대감이 커지고 있다. 임희연 신한금융투자 연구원은 "인증서 시장이 자율 경쟁 체제로 돌아서며 시장 확대가 예상된다"고 분석했다.정부가 주류산업 발전을 가로막던 규제를 대폭 완화하기로 하면서 주류업체 주가가 급등하고 있다. 주류는 온라인 판매를 금지하고 있어 '언택트(비대면)' 보편화에 따라 매출 급락이 불가피했다. 하지만 정부가 병맥주와 소주는 물론 생맥주까지 배달 판매할 수 있도록 방침을 정하면서 국산 주류가 다시 주목을 끌고 있다. 이를 반영해 20일 하이트진로 주가는 전일 대비 2.26% 상승한 3만6200원을 기록했다. 하이트진로는 지난해 출시한 맥주 '테라'와 소주 '진로이즈백'이 인기를 끌면서 빠르게 실적을 끌어올리고 있다. 금융정보업체 에프앤가이드에 따르면 올해 하이트진로가 거둘 것으로 예상되는 영업이익은 1791억원으로 집계됐다. 이는 지난해보다 103.06% 급등한 수치다. 수익률이 높은 주류의 특성상 매출이 늘면서 영업이익률도 급등할 것으로 전망된다. 하이트진로는 지난해 영업이익률이 4.34%에 그쳤지만, 올해 7.83%로 치솟을 전망이다. 매출과 영업이익률이 동반 상승하는 선순환에 진입한 것이다. 하이트진로 주가는 코로나19 사태에 따른 소비심리 위축에 대한 우려로 지난 3월 2만1150원까지 떨어졌지만, 불과 한 달 사이 71.2% 치솟았다.롯데칠성 또한 모처럼 주가가 반등하면서 화색이 돌고 있다. 롯데칠성은 지난해 반일감정에 따른 불매운동이 벌어지면서 주력 제품 '처음처럼'의 시장점유율이 급락한 뒤로 좀처럼 회복하지 못하고 있다. 또한 야심 차게 출시한 맥주 '클라우드'가 시장에 안착하지 못하면서 적자가 지속되고 있는 상황이다. 탄산수 등과 같은 음료 부문이 여전히 견고한 실적을 보이고 있지만, 현금 창출력이 뛰어난 주류사업에서 부진하며 주가가 좀처럼 반등하지 못하고 있었다. 그러던 가운데 롯데칠성 주가는 20일 전일 대비 2.33% 상승해 11만원을 기록하며 장을 마쳤다. 롯데칠성 주가는 지난달 19일 7만8900원까지 떨어졌지만 한 달 사이 39.4% 급등했다.그만큼 주류주가 경기 급락에도 주가 수준을 유지하는 방어주로서 면모를 드러내고 있다. 특히 최근 들어 정부가 주류산업 규제를 완화하기로 하면서 실적 향상에 대한 기대도 받고 있다. 조미진 NH투자증권 연구원은 "롯데칠성은 판촉 효율화 등과 같은 강력한 구조조정과 다방면에서 경쟁력 제고를 위한 노력으로 올해 하반기에는 의미 있는 수준의 실적 반등이 가능할 전망"이라고 밝혔다.

2020.02.06.	뉴스1	한화금융, 새 성과관리체계 OKR 도입…"디지털 전환 가속화"	기존 1년 단위 성과관리에서 최소 주 단위로 '빠르게'"급변하는 환경에 민첩∙유연하게 대응하기 위한 조직문화 장착"김승연 한화그룹 회장이 지난 2일 신년사를 하고 있다.(한화그룹 제공) © 뉴스1(서울=뉴스1) 민정혜 기자 = 한화생명, 한화손해보험, 한화투자증권, 한화자산운용으로 구성된 한화 금융계열사가 짧게는 주간, 길게는 분기 단위로 성과를 관리하는 새로운 성과관리체계 OKR(Objective and Key Results)을 도입한다고 6일 밝혔다. 한화 금융계열사는 대내외 환경에 민첩하게 대응해 디지털 전환을 가속화하겠다는 계획이다. OKR은 '어떤 방향으로 갈 것인가(Objective)'와 '그곳에 가고 있다는 것을 어떻게 알 수 있는지(Key results)'의 합성어다. OKR은 회사가 목표의 방향을 설정하면 부서와 직원이 자발적으로 짧은 단위의 전략을 세우는 방식이다. 부서와 직원들은 목표를 이룰 수 있는 핵심 결과 지표를 정하고, 단기 주요 활동 리스트를 만든다. 이후 결과 지표를 확인하며 성과를 평가하는 시스템이다.  OKR은 기존 연간 단위였던 성과관리지표인 KPI(Key Performance Indicator)에 비해 주기가 짧고, 부서와 직원의 자발성을 요구한다. 또 수치보단 전략 중심으로 무게 추가 옮겨간다.  OKR은 IT기업이나 스타트업에서 주요 사용된다. 구글, 유튜브, 페이스북 등 포춘 500대 글로벌 기업의 25%가 OKR을 적용하고 있다. 특히 40명의 소수 조직이었던 구글이 글로벌 기업으로 성장하는데 가장 결정적 요인인 것으로 알려져 있다. 국내 금융사에선 한화 금융계열사가 선제적으로 도입했다. 디지털 기반으로 재편되고 있는 금융환경에서 민첩하고 유연하게 대응할 수 있는 조직문화를 장착하기 위한 노력이다. 김승연 한화그룹 회장은 신년사에서 “전사 차원의 디지털 트랜스포메이션을 가속화해 4차 산업 혁명시대의 경쟁력을 적극 확보해야 한다"고 강조한 바 있다. 한화 금융계열사는 OKR 도입에 앞서 2019년부터 특정 업무 단위에 애자일(Agile) 업무 방식을 적용했다. OKR과 애자일(Agile) 조직의 시너지 효과로 불확실성이 높은 환경 변화에 빠르게 대응하겠다는 구상이다. 애자일은 '민첩한', '기민한'이란 뜻으로 부서 간 경계를 허물고 필요에 맞게 소규모 팀을 구성해 업무를 수행하는 조직문화를 말한다. 한화생명은 미래전략실, 기술전략실, 글로벌네트워크본부 등 미래 혁신을 추진하는 주요 본부를 애자일 조직으로 운영하고 있다. 한화투자증권도 작년 애자이혁신실을 신설했다. 한화 금융계열사는 OKR 도입에 발맞춰 애자일(Agile) 조직을 확대할 계획이다. 한화 금융계열사는 OKR 진척도를 수시로 모니터링 하는 IT 시스템을 각 사에 구축해 연착륙을 돕는다. 또 한화 금융계열사 차원에서 운영 전담조직과 코치를 양성하고, 중간 점검과 리뷰를 할 수 있는 협의체도 구성할 계획이다. 한화 금융계열사 관계자는 "핀테크(FinTech)가 아닌 테크핀(TechFin)이라는 말이 나올 정도로 디지털 기술이 금융업 전반을 견인한다"며 "이번 전사적 OKR 도입으로 새로운 환경에 유연하게 대응해 한화 금융계열사들의 디지털 트랜스포메이션이 가속화될 것으로 기대한다"고 밝혔다.mjh@news1.kr▶ [ 해피펫 ]  ▶ [터닝 포인트 2020] 구매!▶ 네이버 메인에서 [뉴스1] 구독하기![© 뉴스1코리아(news1.kr), 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=421&aid=0004447679
2020.02.06.	서울경제	한화 금융계열사, 구글式 성과평가체계 도입한다	김동원 한화생명 상무 진두지휘증권 등 전 계열사에 단계 도입애자일 조직 도입 따른 후속조치[서울경제] 한화(000880)금융 계열사가 연간 단위, 조직 중심의 성과관리체계인 핵심성과지표(KPI) 대신 구글·페이스북 등 디지털 기업의 단기·프로젝트 중심 성과체계인 ‘OKR(Objective and Key Results)’을 단계적으로 도입한다. 김승연 한화그룹 회장의 차남인 김동원(사진) 한화생명(088350) 상무가 최고디지털전략책임자(CDSO)로서 디지털 전환을 진두지휘하면서 금융 계열사 중심의 조직 혁신이 가속화하고 있다는 평가다. 한화생명·한화투자증권(003530) 등 한화 금융 계열사는 6일 지난해 애자일 조직 도입에 따른 후속 조치로 새로운 성과관리체계인 ‘OKR’을 도입한다고 밝혔다.애자일 조직이란 소규모 팀을 중심으로 업무를 수행하는 조직으로 정보기술(IT) 기업에서 널리 도입됐고 최근에는 금융권으로도 확대되면서 한화 금융 계열사도 지난해부터 특정 업무 단위에 애자일 방식을 도입했다.OKR은 애자일 조직에 적합한 성과관리체계로 매년 연말·연초 연간 목표를 설정하는 KPI 방식과 달리 주간·월간·분기 단위로 단기 목표를 설정해 민첩하고 유연하게 대응할 수 있다는 장점이 있다. 또 회사가 큰 틀의 목표를 설정하면, 각 부서와 직원이 자발적으로 목표를 설정하는 쌍방향 방식으로 톱다운(하향식) 방식의 KPI에 비해 자율성이 높고 목표 달성률도 높다.구글·유튜브·페이스북 등 포춘 500대 글로벌 기업의 25%가 OKR을 실행하고 있으며 특히 40명의 소수 조직이었던 구글이 글로벌 기업으로 성장하는 데 가장 결정적 요인으로 OKR이 꼽힌다.한화 금융 계열사는 올해부터 조직 단위 OKR을 수립해 적용하고 OKR의 진척도를 수시로 모니터링하는 IT 시스템도 구축하기로 했다. 또 운영 전담조직과 코치를 양성하고, 중간점검 및 리뷰를 할 수 있는 협의체도 마련할 계획이다.김승연 회장이 올해 신년사에서 전사 차원의 디지털 트랜스포메이션과 4차 산업혁명 시대의 경쟁력 확보를 강조한 만큼 김 상무를 중심으로 금융 계열사의 디지털 전환이 속도를 낼 것으로 전망된다.한화생명 관계자는 “핀테크(FinTech)가 아닌 테크핀(TechFin)이라는 말이 나올 정도로 디지털 기술이 금융업 전반을 견인하고 있다”며 “이번 전사적 OKR 도입으로 새로운 환경에 유연하게 대응해 디지털 전환을 가속화할 것”이라고 말했다./서은영기자 supia927@sedaily.com[서울경제 바로가기]▶ '한 눈에 쏙' 새로워진 서울경제 모바일 페이지를 만나보세요.

2020.06.04.	코리아중앙데일리	Innovation galore, from drone delivery to cash on the run	A foreign exchange vending machine displayed at the Hotel Fair at COEX in 2019. [YONHAP]     People in a rush trying to catch a flight will no longer have to wait until the next morning for banks to open to convert their Korean won to dollars or other foreign currencies.      They will be able to request the conversion via an app and then simply pick up the cash on their way to the airport at drive-throughs set up in places like parking lots or gas stations without leaving the comfort of their cars, even after business hours. They could even get their currency exchanged at the airline counter when picking up their fight ticket.      Some could even get their currency delivered.      The maximum amount for a single person will be set at $2,000 per exchange.      This is one of the ideas that the government discussed during its innovation strategy meeting on Thursday, along with the idea of allowing parcel delivery via drones and allowing local residents to utilize home-sharing services like Airbnb, which is currently limited to foreign guests.      Brokerage firms and credit card issuers will be allowed to directly convert foreigner currency. Currently, foreign investors have to wire the funds via foreign banks. The regulation that requires fintech companies to have two foreign exchange experts will be relaxed as well.      The changes are expected to not only usher in innovation but also benefit consumers.      The government said it will review existing regulations related to foreign currency exchange and immediately allow activities that do not violate the existing laws. For those that need legislative changes, the government will come up with reform bills by September.      “Innovative attempts are concentrating on convergence, non-human-to-human contact, foreign exchange and wire services,” Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said during an innovation strategy meeting held with the private sector and scholars on Thursday. “However, it is a fact that regulations have restricted the spread of high-quality innovation.”      The government also said it will work towards allowing drones to deliver packages from 2025 by providing support as well as regulatory reform.      The Finance Minister said the government will also actively engage controversial businesses that need social consensus where there’s a clash between the newcomers and existing businesses.      “There’s an expression ‘one step back to move forward,'” Hong said. “For everyone to move forward, [interest parties] have to take a step back.”      One of the businesses being targeted is room-sharing services like Airbnb. Such businesses can now only host foreigners. Despite the regulation, platforms such as Airbnb continued to provide accommodations to Koreans, irking the existing lodging industry.    The Finance Minster said discussions on these innovative changes are essential.     “The post coronavirus era is expected to bring about significant socioeconomic structural changes, especially along with the sharp increase of non-human-to-human contact and digitalization speeding up the progress of the fourth industrial revolution,” Finance Minister Hong said.      “Our government and our economy’s capacity in meeting the challenge will determine whether we will leap ahead as a leading country in the post coronavirus era.”    BY LEE HO-JEONG  [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=640&aid=0000000965

2020.02.06.	스포츠조선	한화 금융계열사, 새 성과관리체계 'OKR' 도입	한화그룹은 금융 계열사(생명, 손해보험, 투자증권, 자산운용)가 새로운 성과관리체계 'OKR(Objective and Key Results)'을 도입한다고 6일 밝혔다. OKR은 IT기업이나 스타트업에서 사용된 반면 국내 금융사에서는 낯선 지표인데, 이번에 한화금융 계열사가 선제적으로 도입했다. 디지털 기반으로 재편되고 있는 금융환경에서, 민첩하고 유연하게 대응할 수 있는 조직문화를 장착하기 위한 방법으로 OKR을 선택한 것이다.한화그룹 김승연 회장은 올해 신년사에서 "전사차원의 디지털 트랜스포메이션을 가속화해 4차산업혁명시대의 경쟁력을 적극 확보해야 한다."고 강조한 바 있다. OKR은 '어떤 방향으로 갈 것인가(Objective)'와 '그곳에 가고 있다는 것을 어떻게 알 수 있는지(Key results)'의 합성어로 변화하는 환경에 맞춰 지속적으로 추적하고 변화해가는 새로운 성과관리체계다. 구글, 유튜브, 페이스북 등 포춘 500대 글로벌 기업의 25%가 실행하고 있다. 한화금융 계열사는 OKR을 도입하기에 앞서, 지난해부터 특정 업무 단위에 애자일(Agile) 업무 방식 도입을 추진했다. 주요 금융 계열사인 한화생명은 미래전략실, 기술전략실, 글로벌네트워크본부 등 미래 혁신을 추진하는 주요 본부를 애자일 조직으로 운영해 오고 있으며, 한화투자증권도 작년 Agile혁신실을 신설한 바 있다. 부서 간 경계를 허물고 필요에 맞게 소규모 팀을 구성해 업무를 수행하는 애자일 조직의 특성상, 새로운 성과관리체계의 필요성도 커졌다. 이에 한화금융 계열사는 올해부터 조직단위별 OKR을 수립해 적용한다. 성공적인 안착을 위해 수립한 OKR 진척도를 수시 모니터링 할 수 있는 IT 시스템도 구축한다. 또한 운영 전담조직과 코치를 양성하고, 중간점검 및 리뷰를 할 수 있는 협의체도 마련할 계획이다.OKR의 가장 큰 특징은 기존 성과관리지표인 KPI(Key Performance Indicator)에 비해 스피드를 최대한 끌어 올렸다는 것이다. KPI는 연 단위 평가인데 비해, OKR은 짧게는 수 주, 길게는 분기 단위로 목표 관리가 가능하다. 대내외 환경에 민첩하게 대응할 수 있어, 디지털 혁신 시대에 가장 적합한 지표로 평가 받고 있다. 또한 OKR은 회사가 먼저 목표를 정하면, 부서와 직원이 자발적으로 목표를 설정하는 쌍방향 방식이다. 반면, KPI는 지금도 대부분의 기업들이 사용하는 지표로서, 주로 Top-down(하향식)으로 목표 수립이 이뤄진다. 한화금융 계열사 관계자는 "핀테크(FinTech)가 아닌 테크핀(TechFin)이라는 말이 나올 정도로 디지털 기술이 금융업 전반을 견인한다고 볼 수 있다"며, "이번 전사적 OKR 도입으로 새로운 환경에 유연하게 대응함으로써, 한화금융 계열사들의 디지털 트랜스포메이션이 가속화 될 것으로 기대한다"고 밝혔다. 김소형기자 compact@sportschosun.com▶2020 신년운세 보러가기▶눈으로 보는 동영상 뉴스 핫템- Copyrightsⓒ 스포츠조선(http://sports.chosun.com/), 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=076&aid=0003528092

2020.06.15.	매경닷컴	Seoul envisions becoming tech hotbed by hosting Asian startup fair in Sept: mayor	[Photo by Kim Jae-hoon] Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon vowed to make the Asian startup festival in Seoul a platform for startups to become the “new heroes” in the post-coronavirus era.“All opportunities emerge out of a crisis,” Park said in an interview with Maeil Business Newspaper after Seoul Metropolitan Government and South Korea’s Maekyung Media Group agreed to jointly host what would be Asia’s largest conference for tech startups. The event, dubbed “Try Everything,” would be held on Sept. 16-18 in central Seoul together with Maekyung’s annual World Knowledge Forum. Park expected the gathering to be an opportunity to promote Seoul’s potential as an entrepreneurial hotbed.“Global investors’ interest in Seoul has never been higher, with Korea’s successful response to COVID-19 drawing attention to the country’s biomedical prowess,” Park said. Seoul has been holding a number of online conferences, most recently the CAC (City Against COVID-19) Global Summit 2020 in early June, but Try Everything is likely to be the city’s highlight event this year, Park said. As part of Seoul’s efforts to help startups build a global network even at the initial stages, the city has being working hard to host overseas accelerators, including China’s Dagongfang and the Silicon Valley-based Plug and Play Tech Center, Park said.  Park added that he met with Eric Schmidt, Google’s former chief executive, this year to pitch the idea of making Seoul a site for one of Google R&D centers and a candidate for Sidewalk Labs, a smart city development project by Google parent Alphabet. Companies can tap Seoul’s deep pool of global talent, the mayor stressed. There is no city in the world with such a high density of intellectual capital, he explained, as Seoul is home to 54 universities and clusters of R&D facilities.Park has set out to make Seoul one of the world’s top five entrepreneurial cities. Under this ambitious initiative, six industrial clusters have been designated throughout the city: Hongneung in biomedical, Yangjae in artificial intelligence and big data, Magok in R&D, Guro G-Valley in internet of things, Sangam digital media city (DMC) in cultural contents, and Mapo/Yeouido in blockchain and fintech. This year, the city plans to spend 294.7 billion won ($243.4 million) to accelerate project growth, support global strategies and bolster clusters. Park said the investment would help more than 300 startups take off globally.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=009&aid=0004595451

2020.03.23.	데일리안	[기자의 눈] 금융당국, 야심차게 준비한 '핀테크 행사' 어찌하랴	금융위원회 제공"올해 '코리아 핀테크 위크'는 작년 보다 2배 예산이 투입돼 규모가 확대됩니다."금융위원회는 '코리아 핀테크 위크(Korea Fintech Week) 2020' 개최 여부를 두고 고민에 빠졌다.신종 코로나 바이러스 감염증(코로나19) 여파로 면대면 접촉이 불가피한 회의와 모임 등 일정이 취소되면서 행사를 열어야할지 말지 갈피를 잡지 못하고 있기 때문이다.이번 행사는 금융당국이 역점을 두고 추진하는 '혁신금융'의 핵심 정책인 핀테크를 소개하는 자리이자 연중행사 가운데 가장 큰 규모로 열리는 행사다.지난해에 이어 두 번째로 열리는 이번 행사의 주제는 '핀테크를 통한 개방형 혁신'이다. 올해는 행사공간이 더 넓어져 100개 이상의 개별 전시공간이 마련된다. 지난해(54개 부스)의 약 두 배다.올해 행사에선 핀테크 스케일업 추진 전략과 연계해 해외 진출과 투자를 위한 특별 세션, 부대‧상설행사는 물론 혁신적 아이디어를 발굴하기 위해 새로운 핀테크 사업 모델 설명회도 계획하고 있다.이미 금융위는 금융공공기관을 중심으로 핀테크기업의 투자유치 기회를 적극 부여하고 서울 마포에 소재한 '프론트1(Front1)'을 기반으로 스타트업 육성기반도 확충하기로 하는 등 향후 4년 간 3000억원 규모의 '핀테크 혁신펀드' 운영에 나서기로 했다.지난해 처음으로 열린 코리아 핀테크 위크는 핀테크 관련 업체와 금융회사 등 기업 64곳이 참여하고, 1만명 이상이 방문하는 등 성황리에 마쳤다. 당시 핀테크 기업과 국내외 투자자 연계를 통해 300억원 규모의 투자 유치 기회도 확보했다.예정대로라면 올해 코리아 핀테크 위크는 오는 5월 28~30일 서울 동대문디자인플라자(DPP)에서 열린다. 금융위는 아직까지 공식적으로 행사를 취소하진 않은 상황이다.금융위는 행사가 열리는 5월 말까지는 두 달 넘게 남은 만큼 코로나19 사태의 추이를 보면서 판단하겠다는 입장이다. 그사이 관련 업계에서는 "참여해야 할지를 고민하는 중이다", "5월에 맞춰 준비를 해둬야 하는건가"라는 등 혼란스러워하는 상황이다.코리아 핀테크 위크는 지난 1월 15일 박람회 준비 태스크포스(TF)를 발족하고 첫 회의를 한데 이어 지난달 2차회의까지 진행한 뒤 진척이 없다. TF관계자는 "지난달 회의 이후 아직 회의를 열지 못하고 있다"고 전했다.다른 정부부처나 공공기관도 4월까지는 자체 행사를 취소하거나 축소하고 있지만, 5월 일정표까진 '미정'으로 남겨두고 있는 만큼 향후 분위기를 보면서 따라가겠다는 것이다. 상황을 지켜보며 '남들이 밟고 지나간 발자국을 따라 걷는' 소극적 판단이 이번 행사 개최 과정에도 작용했다.최근 금융위는 주가 폭락과 환율 급등 등 금융시장 불안이 최고조에 달했음에도 불구하고 시장의 속도를 따라가지 못하고 뒷북 대책을 내놓고 있다는 비판에 직면한 상황이다. 금융위 안팎에선 "당장 금융시장 전망도 어려운데, '고작' 핀테크 행사를 예측할 수 있겠느냐"는 얘기가 나온다.데일리안 이충재 기자 (cj5128@empal.com)ⓒ (주)데일리안 - 무단전재, 변형, 무단배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=110&oid=119&aid=0002390897
2020.02.06.	서울경제	한화 금융계열사, 구글式 성과평가체계 도입한다	김동원 한화생명 상무 진두지휘증권 등 전 계열사에 단계 도입애자일 조직 도입 따른 후속조치[서울경제] 한화(000880)금융 계열사가 연간 단위, 조직 중심의 성과관리체계인 핵심성과지표(KPI) 대신 구글·페이스북 등 디지털 기업의 단기·프로젝트 중심 성과체계인 ‘OKR(Objective and Key Results)’을 단계적으로 도입한다. 김승연 한화그룹 회장의 차남인 김동원(사진) 한화생명(088350) 상무가 최고디지털전략책임자(CDSO)로서 디지털 전환을 진두지휘하면서 금융 계열사 중심의 조직 혁신이 가속화하고 있다는 평가다. 한화생명·한화투자증권(003530) 등 한화 금융 계열사는 6일 지난해 애자일 조직 도입에 따른 후속 조치로 새로운 성과관리체계인 ‘OKR’을 도입한다고 밝혔다.애자일 조직이란 소규모 팀을 중심으로 업무를 수행하는 조직으로 정보기술(IT) 기업에서 널리 도입됐고 최근에는 금융권으로도 확대되면서 한화 금융 계열사도 지난해부터 특정 업무 단위에 애자일 방식을 도입했다.OKR은 애자일 조직에 적합한 성과관리체계로 매년 연말·연초 연간 목표를 설정하는 KPI 방식과 달리 주간·월간·분기 단위로 단기 목표를 설정해 민첩하고 유연하게 대응할 수 있다는 장점이 있다. 또 회사가 큰 틀의 목표를 설정하면, 각 부서와 직원이 자발적으로 목표를 설정하는 쌍방향 방식으로 톱다운(하향식) 방식의 KPI에 비해 자율성이 높고 목표 달성률도 높다.구글·유튜브·페이스북 등 포춘 500대 글로벌 기업의 25%가 OKR을 실행하고 있으며 특히 40명의 소수 조직이었던 구글이 글로벌 기업으로 성장하는 데 가장 결정적 요인으로 OKR이 꼽힌다.한화 금융 계열사는 올해부터 조직 단위 OKR을 수립해 적용하고 OKR의 진척도를 수시로 모니터링하는 IT 시스템도 구축하기로 했다. 또 운영 전담조직과 코치를 양성하고, 중간점검 및 리뷰를 할 수 있는 협의체도 마련할 계획이다.김승연 회장이 올해 신년사에서 전사 차원의 디지털 트랜스포메이션과 4차 산업혁명 시대의 경쟁력 확보를 강조한 만큼 김 상무를 중심으로 금융 계열사의 디지털 전환이 속도를 낼 것으로 전망된다.한화생명 관계자는 “핀테크(FinTech)가 아닌 테크핀(TechFin)이라는 말이 나올 정도로 디지털 기술이 금융업 전반을 견인하고 있다”며 “이번 전사적 OKR 도입으로 새로운 환경에 유연하게 대응해 디지털 전환을 가속화할 것”이라고 말했다./서은영기자 supia927@sedaily.com[서울경제 바로가기]▶ '한 눈에 쏙' 새로워진 서울경제 모바일 페이지를 만나보세요.

2020.04.27.	이코노미스트	[핀테크 스타트업 위협하는 은행의 반격] 규제에 묶인 사이 ‘아이디어 승부 시대’ 끝	기존 금융권의 벤치마킹 속도 빨라… 덩치 키우거나 기술력으로 차별화해야국내에선 성공한 핀테크 스타트업을 찾아보기 힘들다는 평가가 지배적이다. 혁신적인 서비스로 주목받거나 이용자 수를 급격히 늘리며 일부 분야에서 전투에 승리한 스타트업은 많았지만, 넓고 넓은 금융 산업의 전쟁터에서 자신만의 영역을 확보한 업체는 찾기 어려워서다. 스타트업 업계에서는 정부 규제에 발목을 잡히면서 실기(失期)했다는 점을 원인으로 지목한다. 그 사이 은행과 증권사 등 기존 업체들은 핀테크 업체들에 대응하는 서비스를 속속 마련했다. 한편에서는 이제 핀테크 분야에서는 아이디어만으로 승부하는 시대가 지났다는 이야기도 나온다.  핀테크(fintech)는 이름 그대로 ‘금융(finance)’과 ‘기술(technology)’이 결합한 서비스를 가리킨다. 금융만 하더라도 워낙 범위가 넓다보니 성공의 기준 또한 명확하지 않다. 다만 미국 시장조사 업체 CB인사이트가 집계한 전세계 ‘유니콘 (기업가치 1조원 이상 스타트업)’ 스타트업에 국내 핀테크 업체로 비바리퍼블리카가 포함됐다. 모바일 금융플랫폼‘토스’를 운영하는 비바리퍼블리카의 기업가치는 22억 달러(약 2조7000억원)라는 평가를 받고 있다. 기업가치만 놓고 보면 국내에서 가장 성공한 핀테크 스타트업인 셈이다.  다만 전세계 핀테크 업체와 비교해보면 국내 핀테크 업계의 성적은 미흡한 수준이다. CB인사이트 집계에 포함된 핀테크 스타트업은 61곳이다. 핀테크에 기반한 미국 전자지급결제대행(PG) 사업자 스트라이프(Stripe)와 인도의 결제 애플리케이션 페이TM(Paytm)의 모회사인 원97커뮤니케이션즈 등이 각각 360억 달러(약 44조3600억원), 160억 달러(약 19조7000억원)로 선두권에 위치해 있다.국내 유일 핀테크 유니콘도 적자 행진유니콘 반열에 오른 비바리퍼블리카도 아직은 성공했다는 칭호를 붙이기에는 이르다는 평가가 지배적이다. 은행업과 증권업 진출 등 새로운 도전을 지켜봐야겠지만 핵심 사업 모델만 놓고 보면 한계가 분명해서다. 토스는 계좌·카드조회, P2P펀드, 보험분석등 다양한 서비스를 제공하고 있다. 그러나 토스의 핵심 서비스라고 할 수 있는 것은 간편 송금을 포함한 결제서비스다. 수익을 내기 어려운 분야다. 대형 은행이나 카드사들도 계좌이체 수수료나 결제 수수료만으로는 사업을 유지하기 힘들기 때문이다.  국내 시중 은행들은 이제 간단한 몇가지 조건을 만족시키는 형태로 출금이나 이체 수수료를 면제하고 있다. 카드업체들도 결제 사업에서는 매년 수천억원의 적자를 기록하고 있다. 성용훈 한화투자증권 연구원은 “해외에서 결제 관련 핀테크 업체들의 성공 사례가 나올 수 있었던 배경에는 거래 인프라가 미흡하거나 비쌌기 때문인데 국내 시장과는 차이가 있다”며 “국내에서는 기존 플랫폼의 가치를 증대시키는 보조 장치로서의 역할에 그칠 가능성이 높고, 결제 자체만으로 흑자 달성은 불가능에 가깝다”고 평가했다.  토스의 사업 모델은 편리한 무료 서비스를 제공해 이용자를 모으고, 이렇게 모인 이용자들의 광고 노출이나 상품 구매를 통해 수익을 내는 방식이다. 그러나 이 사업 모델은 이제 통용되기 쉽지 않다는 분석이다. 2000년대 초반은 물론, 스마트폰이 산업 생태계를 바꾼 2010년대에도 이런 방식으로 성공한 사례가 많다. 문제는 이제 기술이 발전하면서 더 세부적인 부분까지 측정이 가능해졌다는 점이다. 이용자들의 모든 거래 내역이 전산에 기록되는 금융 산업에서는 특정 이용자들이 얼마나 수익에 기여했는지 측정이 가능하다.  토스는 지난 2017년 신한금융투자 계좌 개설 이벤트를 벌였다. 토스를 통해 계좌를 개설하면 CMA 금리를 우대해주는 이벤트였다. 그리고 CMA 계좌를 기준으로 1년 만에 50만건이 넘는 계좌 개설에 성공했다. 여기까지만 보면 성공적이라고 할 수 있다. 그러나 이렇게 모인 고객들은 우대 금리 혜택만 받고 다른 금융상품에 가입하지 않는 체리피커(cherry picker)가 대부분이었다. 체리피커는 신포도 대신 체리만 골라먹는 사람이라는 뜻으로, 실질적으로는 기업 이익에 도움이 되지 않는 소비자를 지칭한다. 자연스럽게 마케팅 효과에도 의구심이 생길 수밖에 없었다.  마땅한 수익원을 마련하지 못하면서 국내 유일의 핀테크 유니콘 비바리퍼블리카의 손실은 누적되고 있다. 비바리퍼블리카는 2019년 1244억원의 순손실을 냈다. 2016년부터 2018년까지 3년간 기록했던 순손실을 모두 합친 것보다 많다. 비바리퍼블리카는 2016년과 2017년, 2018년에 각각 226억원, 390억원, 445억원의 순손실을 냈다. 손실의 가장 큰 원인은 당연 지급 수수료다. 비바리퍼블리카는 2019년 지급 수수료로 1033억원을 썼다. 2018년에 부담한 지급 수수료는 614억원으로 영업수익(548억원) 보다 많다. 한 스타트업 업계 관계자는 “토스의 간편 송금 서비스는 금융결제원 공동망 이용 수수료를 대신 부담하며 이용자를 불러 모으는 사업 모델”이라며 “공짜를 보고 모인 사람들이라 금융상품 투자로 연결되기가 쉽지 않다는 점에서 한계가 분명하다”고 지적했다.규모·안정성으로 반격하는 전통 금융업체금융 업계에서는 이제 핀테크 스타트업들이 자체 서비스만으로 수익을 내기에는 쉽지 않은 환경이라고 진단하고 있다. 기존 금융업체들이 제공하는 서비스가 불편하던 시기에 핀테크 업체들이 약진해야 했지만 규제에 발목 잡혔다. 그 사이 기존 금융업체들은 핀테크 스타트업들의 서비스를 벤치마크하며 진화했다. 송금과 결제서비스만 놓고 보더라도 이제는 대형 은행들의 어플리케이션에서도 공인인증서 대신 생체인식이나 패턴 인식, 간편 비밀번호만으로도 거래가 가능하다. 대다수 금융업체들의 서비스가 상향평준화하면서 이용자 입장에서는 핀테크 스타트업을 고집할 이유가 없어졌다. 오히려 동일한 조건이라면 금융 산업 특성상 ‘규모의 경제’를 이룬 전통 금융업체들이 유리하다.  송금이나 결제처럼 간단한 서비스와 달리 예금이나 대출, 투자 등에서는 금융업체를 얼마나 신뢰할 수 있는지가 핵심 경쟁력이다. 당연히 규모가 큰 대형 은행과 증권사가 유리하다. 더구나 핀테크 분야에서 대표적인 혁신으로 각광받았던 P2P 대출 업체들의 연체율이 최근 급등하면서 업계 전반에 신뢰성이 흔들리고 있다. 업계 1위인 테라펀딩만 하더라도 세종시 근린생활시설 신축사업 투자 상품에서는 지난 3월 원금 전액 손실이 발생했다. 원금 규모는 총 30억원이나 된다. 지난 1월에도 충남태안 다세대 신축 리파이낸싱 상품과 경기도 파주 연립주택 부동산 PF에서 전액 손실이 발생했다.  P2P 금융플랫폼 미드레이트에 따르면 국내 P2P업체 140 곳의 평균 연체율은 15%를 넘기고 있다. 연체율은 전체 대출 잔액에 대비 30일 이상 연체가 발생한 대출 잔액이 얼마나 되는지를 나타내는 비율이다. 연체율 100%로 모든 대출 상품에서 연체가 진행되고 있는 P2P업체는 더좋은펀드, 빅파이펀딩, 이룸펀딩, 리얼코리아펀딩, 애플펀딩, 이디움펀딩, 세움펀딩 등 8곳이나 된다. 루프펀딩과 팝펀딩도 연체율이 각각 99.7%와 94.26%로 100%에 근접했다. 상황이 이렇다 보니 금리를 조금 더 받기 보다는 안전한 금융 기관을 찾겠다는 투자자들이 늘고 있다.  금융 업계에서는 이제 핀테크 스타트업들이 덩치를 키우거나 차별화된 기술로 무장할 수밖에 없다는 진단이다. 비바리퍼블리카도 기존 사업 모델의 한계를 명확하게 인식하고 있다 보니 덩치를 키우는 행보에 나섰다. 지난 3월 12일 열린 금융위원회 산하 증권선물위원회 정례회의에서는 비바리퍼블리카의 100% 자회사 ‘토스준비법인’의 증권사 설립 예비 인가를 통과시켰다. 토스준비법인은 6개월 내에 본인가를 신청해야하며, 이후 6개월 내에 영업을 개시할 수 있다. 이 보다 앞선 지난 2019년 12월에는 인터넷전문은행 예비인가를 받았다. 토스뱅크 컨소시엄 측에서는 2021년 7월경 사업을 개시할 수 있을 것으로 내다보고 있다. 순조롭다면 비바리퍼블리카는 은행업과 증권업에 진출하며 몸집을 키울 수 있다. 다만 덩치를 키운 비바리퍼블리카가 어떤 성적을 낼지는 지켜볼 필요가 있다. 기존 업체들과 경쟁이 남아있어서다. 김영덕 롯데 엑셀러레이터 상무는 “핀테크 스타트업들은 이제 1라운드를 마치고 2라운드를 시작하는 단계”라며 “누가 고객이 원하는것을 제공할 수 있는지가 경쟁의 본질”이라고 말했다.업계 판도 변화에 차별화 나서야전통 금융업체들의 반격은 해외에서도 마찬가지다. 금융업이 발전한 미국에서는 2015년 베터먼트와 웰스프론트 등 핀테크 업체들이 등장하며 자산관리 분야에서 두각을 나타냈다. 그러나 뱅가드나 피델리티 등 기존 업체들도 핀테크 스타트업의 방식에 대응할 수 있는 서비스를 내놓기 시작하면서 이제는 누가 우위에 있다고 평가하기 어려운 시장이 됐다. 실제로 전세계 로보어드바이저 시장에서 운용자산(AUM) 기준 선두에 있는 업체는 미국 뮤추얼 펀드 1위 업체 뱅가드(Vanguard)다. 뱅가드의 운용자산은 2019년 6월말 기준 1400억 달러에 달한다. 2위는 미국 최대 온라인 증권사 찰스 슈와브(Charles Schwab)가 차지하고 있다. 로보어드바이저 관련 핀테크 스타트업 웰스프론트는 3위에 오르긴 했지만 운용자산은 200억 달러로 1위 뱅가드의 14% 수준이다.질적 측면에서도 전통의 자산관리 업체들의 반격이 거세다. 백앤드벤치마크가 2019년 말 기준으로 집계한 로보어드바이저 순위에서 1위는 피델리티가 차지했다. 피델리티는 미국 뮤추얼 펀드 2위 업체다. 백앤드벤치마크는 사용자 인터페이스(UI)와 사용자 경험(UX), 최저 투자액, 상품 특징, 운용 수수료, 투자 성과 등을 종합해 로보어드바이저 서비스를 평가하고 있다. 이기대 스타트업얼라이언스 이사는 “해외에서도 핀테크 스타트업이 각광받던 시절에는 뱅가드나 피델리티가 망할 수도 있겠다는 이야기가 나왔지만 끄덕 없이 버티고 서 있다”며 “이제는 판도가 바뀌었고 기존 대형 업체들과 직접 경쟁하기 보다는 뱅크샐러드처럼 마이데이터를 활용한 솔루션을 제공하는 식으로 차별화하는 곳이 핀테크 대표 주자로 떠오를 전망”이라고 말했다.- 황건강 기자 hwang.kunkang@joongang.co.kr[정기구독] [콘텐트 구매]				[ⓒ 이코노미스트(jmagazine.joins.com) 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=243&aid=0000009927

2020.05.28.	inews24.com	[금융권 글로벌 공략ⓛ] 될성부른 회사 콕 찍어 적극 인수…'철저한 현지화 전략' 승부수	코로나19 여파에도 캄보디아 잠재력 커 우리은행·국민은행 등 진출 러시[아이뉴스24 이효정 기자] 신한금융과 하나금융이 글로벌 시장에서 지나친 경쟁을 자제하자는 얘기가 나올 정도로 모든 금융권이 최근 몇년간 동남아시아 진출 열기로 뜨거웠다. 하지만 같은 동남아시아에서도 나라마다 금융사들의 생존전략이 차이를 보이고 있다.관문이 좁은 태국은 진출한 업체가 거의 없는 데 반해 요충지인 베트남으로는 쏠림 현상이 뚜렷하다. 요즘 가장 각광받는 곳이 캄보디아다. 국내 제1·2금융권 기업들이 잇따라 현지기업 인수·합병(M&A)에 나서고 있다. 캄보디아 자회사간 합병으로 현지시장을 적극 공략하고 있는 우리은행 캄보디아 법인을 통해 동남아시장 진출 현황을 살펴봤다.◆ 우리은행의 캄보디아 법인 'WB파이낸스'…고객 100% 모두 현지인캄보디아 수도 프놈펜에 위치한 WB파이낸스 본사 전경 [우리은행 ]28일 업계에 따르면 우리은행의 캄보디아 법인인 WB파이낸스는 직원수가 2035명으로 이 가운데 한국인은 5~6명 수준이다. 직원뿐 아니라 이 금융사를 이용하는 고객도 100% 캄보디아 현지인이다.현지 기업을 인수한터라 기본 모토도 철저한 현지화로 시장에서 인정받겠다는 것이다. 이는 법인이나 지점을 설립한 후 먼저 교민과 한국계 기업을 대상으로 하는 영업으로 첫발을 내딛는 통상적인 해외 진출전략과는 차별화된 전략이다.기업문화부터 '우리은행식 캄보디아'로 만들기 위해 점진적으로 바꾸고 있다. 현지에서 근무하고 있는 허진 우리은행 부부장은 인터뷰를 통해 "WB파이낸스 인수 이후 주주변경에 대한 동요를 막기 위해 기존 운영돼 오던 시스템 그대로 운영하면서 현지 기업문화를 이해하는데 노력해 왔다"며 "현지 문화를 존중하면서 우리은행의 경영철학과 선진금융기법을 맞춤화(Customize)해서 적용하고 있다"고 말했다.WB파이낸스는 우리은행이 인수한 현지 기업들을 합병한 금융사다. 우리은행은 2014년과 2018년에 각각 인수한 소액여신전문금융사 우리파이낸스캄보디아와 저축은행 WB파이낸스를 지난 2월에 합병했다.이를테면 진출 초기 소매금융 등에 소규모 투자를 하면서 시장을 검증한 뒤 인수한 기업들을 합병해 덩치를 키우고 투자를 확대하고 있는 셈이다.특히 우리파이낸스캄보디아는 프놈펜 위주 대도시에 영업력이 집중돼 있었고, WB파이낸스는 지방에서 힘을 발휘했기 때문에 두 회사의 합병으로 대도시와 지방 등 지역별로 영업력이 골고루 강화됐다. 우리파이낸스의 20개 지점에서도 수신도 가능하기에 여·수신 영업 모두 갖추는 계기도 됐다.내년에 현지의 리딩 금융사로 거듭나기 위해 지역 밀착형 상품 등 적극적인 마케팅과 함께 디지털 인프라가 부족한 캄보디아에서 모바일 뱅킹 업그레이드로 현지 금융시장을 선점하겠다는 계획이다. 핀테크업체·전자지갑업체 등과의 제휴 등을 포함해 적극적인 행보를 보이고 있다.허진 부부장은 "WB파이낸스는 다양한 리테일 상품 라인업을 위해 신상품 개발은 물론 시장 상황에 맞은 상품으로 기존 상품을 변경 개발하면서 모바일 뱅킹 업그레이드에도 힘쓰고 있다"고 말했다. 이어 "합병 이후 각종 광고 등으로 새로운 WB파이낸스 출범에 대한 마케팅을 하고 있다"고 덧붙였다.◆ "코로나19 여파 있지만"…캄보디아 잠재력 여전히 큰 시장우리은행뿐만 아니라 최근 캄보디아에서는 국내 금융사들이 현지 기업을 인수해 진출을 하려는 사례가 꽤 눈에 띈다.최근 KB국민은행은 소액대출금융기관인 프라삭 마이크로파이낸스사 지분 70%을 인수하는 작업을 완료했다. 2016년에는 JB금융이 프놈펜 상업은행의 지분을 사들이면서 계열 편입했다. 캐피탈업계에서도 DGB캐피탈이 지난 1월 소액금융업을 하고 있는 캄캐피탈(Cam Capital Plc)을 인수했다.업계 관계자는 "사무소부터 시작해서 현지법인까지 설립하는 방식으로 하기까지는 향후 금융시장이 어떻게 바뀔지도 모르고 현지 금융당국의 인허가 속도도 더디다"라며 "캄보디아는 은행 거래가 적고 기본 인프라가 부족한 편이다. 하지만 인건비가 저렴하고 순이자마진(NIM)도 높은 곳이라 금융사 입장에서는 전 국민을 새로운 고객으로 끌어들이 수 있어 관심이 높은 곳이다"라고 밝혔다.캄보디아는 상대적으로 저렴한 노동비용이 강점으로 향후 성장 가능성이 큰 국가다. 캄보디아 중앙은행에 따르면 2014년부터 2018년까지 5년 평균 국내총생산(GDP) 성장률은 7.1%다. 은행·마이크로파이낸스(MFI) 등을 포함한 금융산업 성장률은 5년 평균 23.8%다.우리은행 관계자는 "금융산업 성장률은 GDP 성장률 대비 3배 수준 성장하고 있다"며 "코로나19 사태 전에 국제통화기금(IMF) 등은 캄보디아 경제가 향후 5개년 6~7% 고성장을 전망했다. 이번 사태로 캄보디아 경제·금융산업 성장률이 일시적으로 하락할 수 있지만, 향후 불확실성이 해소되면 고성장으로 회복할 것으로 보고 있다"고 설명했다.이어 "캄보디아의 'WB파이낸스'는 코로나 사태로 국제금융시장 불확실성 증가에 따른 리스크 관리를 강화하고 있다"고 덧붙였다.◆동남아시아 내 다른 지역은?…태국·베트남 극과극 현상 뚜렷캄보디아는 사실 우리 금융사들이 진출해있는 동남아국가들 중에서도 아직까지 진출 점포가 적은 편이다. 금융감독원에 따르면 국책은행·시중은행·카드·증권·보험·캐피탈 등 국내 전체 금융사의 해외 점포 중 아시아에 진출해있는 점포는 사무소·지점·현지법인 등을 포함해 총 294곳이다. 사무소는 실질적인 영업 기능없이 시장 동향 등의 최소 역할만 한다.이 가운데 동남아시아는 156곳이다. 베트남이 54곳으로 가장 많고 인도네시아 25곳, 미얀마 24곳, 싱가포르 20곳이다. 캄보디아는 15곳으로 아직 상대적으로 진출정도가 덜하다. 필리핀은 7곳, 라오스 4곳, 말레이시아 2곳이다. 베트남과 함께 동남아시아의 맹주라 할 수 있는 태국은 오히려 3곳으로 매우 적은 편이다.같은 동남아시아라도 지역별 차이가 벌어지는 것은 각 국가마다 발전 속도가 다르고 현지 금융당국의 규제, 금융시장의 잠재력이 조금씩 차이가 있기 때문이다.일례로 베트남은 현지화도 중요하지만 우리나라 기업들을 대상으로 하는 거점점포의 역할도 필요하다. 이에 비해 태국은 동남아에서도 경제 발전속도가 빠른 편인데도 정작 진출한 국내 금융사들이 적다.업계 관계자는 "지역에 따라 진출 목표가 차이가 있을 수 있다. 캄보디아나 인도네시아처럼 현지화를 목표로 하는 곳도 있지만 뉴욕이나 싱가포르 같은 곳에서는 전세계 많은 금융사들이 진출해 있어 투자금융(IB) 등을 위한 거점점포 역할만 하는 곳도 있다"고 말했다.이어 "베트남의 경우 현지에 진출한 국내 기업을 위한 거점점포면서도 현지화를 위해 법인을 설립, 현지 고객들을 위한 주택담보대출, 디지털 뱅킹 등도 하는 경우가 많다"며 "태국은 진출이 어렵다. (현지 금융당국 규제 등의 영향으로) 굉장히 많은 자본금이 들어간다"며 "과거 한국계 은행들이 진출하려다가 안된 이후 현재 진출이 어려운 편이다"라고 설명했다.태국은 은행에 대한 최소 자본금이 200억 바트 이상이고 2020년까지 외국계 은행에 대한 인허가를 금지한 것으로 알려졌다.과거 우리나라 은행들이 진출했으나 1997년 외환위기 이후 국내 은행들이 태국에서 잇따라 철수하면서 금융관문을 닫았다. 다만 최근에는 KB국민카드가 현지 여신전문금융기업인 제이핀테크(J Fintech Co., Ltd)의 지분 50.99%를 인수하는 등 다시 시장 공략 채비를 하고 있다.이효정기자 hyoj@inews24.com▶네이버 채널에서 '아이뉴스24'를 구독해주세요.▶재밌는 아이뉴스TV 영상보기  ▶아이뉴스24 바로가기[ⓒ 아이뉴스24 무단전재 및 재배포 금지]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=031&aid=0000540454

2020.05.28.	inews24.com	[금융권 글로벌 공략ⓛ] 될성부른 회사 콕 찍어 적극 인수…'철저한 현지화 전략' 승부수	코로나19 여파에도 캄보디아 잠재력 커 우리은행·국민은행 등 진출 러시[아이뉴스24 이효정 기자] 신한금융과 하나금융이 글로벌 시장에서 지나친 경쟁을 자제하자는 얘기가 나올 정도로 모든 금융권이 최근 몇년간 동남아시아 진출 열기로 뜨거웠다. 하지만 같은 동남아시아에서도 나라마다 금융사들의 생존전략이 차이를 보이고 있다.관문이 좁은 태국은 진출한 업체가 거의 없는 데 반해 요충지인 베트남으로는 쏠림 현상이 뚜렷하다. 요즘 가장 각광받는 곳이 캄보디아다. 국내 제1·2금융권 기업들이 잇따라 현지기업 인수·합병(M&A)에 나서고 있다. 캄보디아 자회사간 합병으로 현지시장을 적극 공략하고 있는 우리은행 캄보디아 법인을 통해 동남아시장 진출 현황을 살펴봤다.◆ 우리은행의 캄보디아 법인 'WB파이낸스'…고객 100% 모두 현지인캄보디아 수도 프놈펜에 위치한 WB파이낸스 본사 전경 [우리은행 ]28일 업계에 따르면 우리은행의 캄보디아 법인인 WB파이낸스는 직원수가 2035명으로 이 가운데 한국인은 5~6명 수준이다. 직원뿐 아니라 이 금융사를 이용하는 고객도 100% 캄보디아 현지인이다.현지 기업을 인수한터라 기본 모토도 철저한 현지화로 시장에서 인정받겠다는 것이다. 이는 법인이나 지점을 설립한 후 먼저 교민과 한국계 기업을 대상으로 하는 영업으로 첫발을 내딛는 통상적인 해외 진출전략과는 차별화된 전략이다.기업문화부터 '우리은행식 캄보디아'로 만들기 위해 점진적으로 바꾸고 있다. 현지에서 근무하고 있는 허진 우리은행 부부장은 인터뷰를 통해 "WB파이낸스 인수 이후 주주변경에 대한 동요를 막기 위해 기존 운영돼 오던 시스템 그대로 운영하면서 현지 기업문화를 이해하는데 노력해 왔다"며 "현지 문화를 존중하면서 우리은행의 경영철학과 선진금융기법을 맞춤화(Customize)해서 적용하고 있다"고 말했다.WB파이낸스는 우리은행이 인수한 현지 기업들을 합병한 금융사다. 우리은행은 2014년과 2018년에 각각 인수한 소액여신전문금융사 우리파이낸스캄보디아와 저축은행 WB파이낸스를 지난 2월에 합병했다.이를테면 진출 초기 소매금융 등에 소규모 투자를 하면서 시장을 검증한 뒤 인수한 기업들을 합병해 덩치를 키우고 투자를 확대하고 있는 셈이다.특히 우리파이낸스캄보디아는 프놈펜 위주 대도시에 영업력이 집중돼 있었고, WB파이낸스는 지방에서 힘을 발휘했기 때문에 두 회사의 합병으로 대도시와 지방 등 지역별로 영업력이 골고루 강화됐다. 우리파이낸스의 20개 지점에서도 수신도 가능하기에 여·수신 영업 모두 갖추는 계기도 됐다.내년에 현지의 리딩 금융사로 거듭나기 위해 지역 밀착형 상품 등 적극적인 마케팅과 함께 디지털 인프라가 부족한 캄보디아에서 모바일 뱅킹 업그레이드로 현지 금융시장을 선점하겠다는 계획이다. 핀테크업체·전자지갑업체 등과의 제휴 등을 포함해 적극적인 행보를 보이고 있다.허진 부부장은 "WB파이낸스는 다양한 리테일 상품 라인업을 위해 신상품 개발은 물론 시장 상황에 맞은 상품으로 기존 상품을 변경 개발하면서 모바일 뱅킹 업그레이드에도 힘쓰고 있다"고 말했다. 이어 "합병 이후 각종 광고 등으로 새로운 WB파이낸스 출범에 대한 마케팅을 하고 있다"고 덧붙였다.◆ "코로나19 여파 있지만"…캄보디아 잠재력 여전히 큰 시장우리은행뿐만 아니라 최근 캄보디아에서는 국내 금융사들이 현지 기업을 인수해 진출을 하려는 사례가 꽤 눈에 띈다.최근 KB국민은행은 소액대출금융기관인 프라삭 마이크로파이낸스사 지분 70%을 인수하는 작업을 완료했다. 2016년에는 JB금융이 프놈펜 상업은행의 지분을 사들이면서 계열 편입했다. 캐피탈업계에서도 DGB캐피탈이 지난 1월 소액금융업을 하고 있는 캄캐피탈(Cam Capital Plc)을 인수했다.업계 관계자는 "사무소부터 시작해서 현지법인까지 설립하는 방식으로 하기까지는 향후 금융시장이 어떻게 바뀔지도 모르고 현지 금융당국의 인허가 속도도 더디다"라며 "캄보디아는 은행 거래가 적고 기본 인프라가 부족한 편이다. 하지만 인건비가 저렴하고 순이자마진(NIM)도 높은 곳이라 금융사 입장에서는 전 국민을 새로운 고객으로 끌어들이 수 있어 관심이 높은 곳이다"라고 밝혔다.캄보디아는 상대적으로 저렴한 노동비용이 강점으로 향후 성장 가능성이 큰 국가다. 캄보디아 중앙은행에 따르면 2014년부터 2018년까지 5년 평균 국내총생산(GDP) 성장률은 7.1%다. 은행·마이크로파이낸스(MFI) 등을 포함한 금융산업 성장률은 5년 평균 23.8%다.우리은행 관계자는 "금융산업 성장률은 GDP 성장률 대비 3배 수준 성장하고 있다"며 "코로나19 사태 전에 국제통화기금(IMF) 등은 캄보디아 경제가 향후 5개년 6~7% 고성장을 전망했다. 이번 사태로 캄보디아 경제·금융산업 성장률이 일시적으로 하락할 수 있지만, 향후 불확실성이 해소되면 고성장으로 회복할 것으로 보고 있다"고 설명했다.이어 "캄보디아의 'WB파이낸스'는 코로나 사태로 국제금융시장 불확실성 증가에 따른 리스크 관리를 강화하고 있다"고 덧붙였다.◆동남아시아 내 다른 지역은?…태국·베트남 극과극 현상 뚜렷캄보디아는 사실 우리 금융사들이 진출해있는 동남아국가들 중에서도 아직까지 진출 점포가 적은 편이다. 금융감독원에 따르면 국책은행·시중은행·카드·증권·보험·캐피탈 등 국내 전체 금융사의 해외 점포 중 아시아에 진출해있는 점포는 사무소·지점·현지법인 등을 포함해 총 294곳이다. 사무소는 실질적인 영업 기능없이 시장 동향 등의 최소 역할만 한다.이 가운데 동남아시아는 156곳이다. 베트남이 54곳으로 가장 많고 인도네시아 25곳, 미얀마 24곳, 싱가포르 20곳이다. 캄보디아는 15곳으로 아직 상대적으로 진출정도가 덜하다. 필리핀은 7곳, 라오스 4곳, 말레이시아 2곳이다. 베트남과 함께 동남아시아의 맹주라 할 수 있는 태국은 오히려 3곳으로 매우 적은 편이다.같은 동남아시아라도 지역별 차이가 벌어지는 것은 각 국가마다 발전 속도가 다르고 현지 금융당국의 규제, 금융시장의 잠재력이 조금씩 차이가 있기 때문이다.일례로 베트남은 현지화도 중요하지만 우리나라 기업들을 대상으로 하는 거점점포의 역할도 필요하다. 이에 비해 태국은 동남아에서도 경제 발전속도가 빠른 편인데도 정작 진출한 국내 금융사들이 적다.업계 관계자는 "지역에 따라 진출 목표가 차이가 있을 수 있다. 캄보디아나 인도네시아처럼 현지화를 목표로 하는 곳도 있지만 뉴욕이나 싱가포르 같은 곳에서는 전세계 많은 금융사들이 진출해 있어 투자금융(IB) 등을 위한 거점점포 역할만 하는 곳도 있다"고 말했다.이어 "베트남의 경우 현지에 진출한 국내 기업을 위한 거점점포면서도 현지화를 위해 법인을 설립, 현지 고객들을 위한 주택담보대출, 디지털 뱅킹 등도 하는 경우가 많다"며 "태국은 진출이 어렵다. (현지 금융당국 규제 등의 영향으로) 굉장히 많은 자본금이 들어간다"며 "과거 한국계 은행들이 진출하려다가 안된 이후 현재 진출이 어려운 편이다"라고 설명했다.태국은 은행에 대한 최소 자본금이 200억 바트 이상이고 2020년까지 외국계 은행에 대한 인허가를 금지한 것으로 알려졌다.과거 우리나라 은행들이 진출했으나 1997년 외환위기 이후 국내 은행들이 태국에서 잇따라 철수하면서 금융관문을 닫았다. 다만 최근에는 KB국민카드가 현지 여신전문금융기업인 제이핀테크(J Fintech Co., Ltd)의 지분 50.99%를 인수하는 등 다시 시장 공략 채비를 하고 있다.이효정기자 hyoj@inews24.com▶네이버 채널에서 '아이뉴스24'를 구독해주세요.▶재밌는 아이뉴스TV 영상보기  ▶아이뉴스24 바로가기[ⓒ 아이뉴스24 무단전재 및 재배포 금지]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=031&aid=0000540454
2020.01.23.	매경닷컴	Kakao Pay gets pre-approval to take over Baro Investment & Securities	Kakao Pay, mobile payment service under South Korea’s leading messenger app KakaoTalk, has passed the government’s review process for its acquisition of Baro Investment & Securities Co., moving a step closer to becoming the country’s first fintech company offering broad capital investment options. The Securities & Futures Commission under Financial Services Commission on Wednesday gave a preliminary approval to Kakao Pay to take over Baro Investment & Securities, leaving just one administrative step towards a full acquisition. Kakao Pay filed for the government review in April last year after it acquired a 60 percent stake in the firm for 40 billion won ($34.3 million) in October 2018. The process has been delayed since Brian Kim, the largest shareholder of Kakao and the board chair, was indicted on a charge of violating the fair trade law. In Korea, anyone who is fined or more than fined for violation of financial laws is not allowed to become the largest stakeholder of a financial institution for the next five years. But after Kim was acquitted in the final trial, the financial authorities kicked off the acquisition review process. The final decision on the buyout will be made at the Financial Services Commission’s meeting due on Feb. 5. Once it gets a final nod, Kakao Pay becomes the first fintech name in the capital market of Korea that so far has been dominated by financial companies and asset managers. It would be able to offer investment benefits and financial products to customers, on top of existing payment and wire transfer services. Some experts say Kakao Pay will grow fast to become the investment market No. 1 if it adds a stock trade option to the messenger platform KakaoTalk as planned.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=009&aid=0004505638
2020.06.07.	edaily	중국계 비트빗, 블록체인 ‘해운대·송정해수욕장 전자결제’ 참여	[이데일리 김현아 기자]중국계 블록체인 통합 비즈니스 컨설팅 기업인 비트빗 그룹(의장 필립 최)이 블록체인 특구 내 블록체인 기반 스마트 관광 서비스를 도입한 실증사업을 추진하고자 해운대·송정 해수욕장 전자결제시스템 위탁사인 주식회사 이노텍과 블록체인 기반 시범서비스 사업 협약을 체결했다.해운대구청에서 추진 중인 해운대·송정 해수욕장 전자결제시스템(구 스마트비치) 구축 사업은 해수욕장 파라솔 임대 단체 등 위탁 운영 업체의 ‘수익 투명성’ 확보와 관광객의 편의를 제공하기 위해 관할 관청에서 시행하는 주요 사업이다. 올해 시범서비스 시행을 기반으로 2021년도에는 블록체인 기반 서비스의 새로운 패러다임을 선보이며, 블록체인 특구 부산의 위상을 강화할 수 있을 것으로 기대된다.이번 협약을 통해 비트빗 그룹은 블록체인 기반 스마트 관광 서비스 실증 사업을 위한 시범서비스를 제공할 수 있는 발판을 마련하게 됐다. 이를 위해 비트빗 그룹은 블록체인 기반 스마트 관광 서비스 기반의 실증사업(시범서비스)을 위해 생체정보 인증 분야에서 세계적인 홍채인증 기술을 보유하고 있는 ㈜이리언스, 글로벌 결제시스템과 블록체인 서비스사업을 진행하고 있는 DNC재단, 그리고 가상자산 거래소 플라이빗(Flybit)과 비즈니스 모델 고도화를 위한 협업에 속도를 높이고 있다.최근 코로나19로 인한 중앙정부의 비대면 비접촉 정책 시행에 부응하기 위해 기존 전자결제시스템에 블록체인 기반 첨단 홍채인식기술을 활용한 결제 서비스 도입을 검토하는 가운데 비트빗 그룹은 해운대구 전용 어플을 통해 해수욕장 내 피서용품(튜브, 파라솔 등) 대여, 각종 식음료 딜리버리(배달) 등의 시범서비스를 선보일 예정이다.이번 해운대·송정 해수욕장의 전자결제시스템 사업의 위탁사인 이노텍 측은 “비트빗 그룹의 블록체인 기반 글로벌 통합 컨설팅 실적과 사업성 그리고 성장성을 높이 평가하여 이번 해운대구 전자결제시스템 사업의 공동 협약을 체결”했다고 협약 배경을 밝혔다.비트빗 그룹 필립 최 의장은 “블록체인 기반 전자결제시스템 도입이 블록체인 특구 부산의 실증, 시범서비스사업으로서 선도적인 역할을 할 것으로 기대“ 한다며, “블록체인 기반 홍채 등록과 인증을 통해 피서지에서 발생할 수 있는 미아 발생을 예방하고 방지할 수 있는 시범서비스도 함께 선보일 예정”이라고 전했다.이를 위해 전세계 사회문제인 실종자, 미아 찾기 등 획기적인 예방과 신속한 해결을 위한 생체인식 바이오 기술과 블록체인 융합된 WAY platform의 개발사인 홍콩 이핀테크(E-FINTECH)와도 공동 협업체계를 마련할 예정이다.비트빗(BITbeat) 그룹은 비트빗 그룹은 세계적인 명성과 블록체인 통합 기술을 보유하고 있는 비티씨차이나 그룹(BTC China)의 공식 파트너다.BTC 차이나 그룹은 2011년 6월 9일 중국 비트코인 전문가 양린커 회장이 창립했다. 세계 BTC 거래량 중 80%를 점유했으며 8년간 안정적으로 운영해 2017년 8월 가입자 100만명을 돌파한 세계에서 가장 오래된 글로벌 암호화폐 거래소다.비트빗 그룹은 올해 특금법 개정안을 통해 공식적으로 명명된 가상자산인 암호화폐의 실사용 프로젝트에 대한 글로벌 진출 지원, 글로벌 디지털 자산거래소에 세계최고 수준 홍채 보안기술 도입, 스마트폰 어플과 거래소의 생태계 호환 등 가상의 자산을 실물경제에 접목시켜 블록체인 생태계를 조성하는 글로벌 블록체인 통합 비즈니스 컨설팅 회사다.김현아 (chaos@edaily.co.kr)네이버에서 ‘이데일리’ 구독하기▶청춘뉘우스~ 스냅타임▶＜ⓒ종합 경제정보 미디어 이데일리 - 무단전재 & 재배포 금지＞	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=105&oid=018&aid=0004658682

2020.04.27.	이코노미스트	[2020년 한국 핀테크 원년 될까] ‘안정-혁신’ ‘집중-분산’ ‘보호-투명’, 고차원 방정식의 딜레마	핀테크는 앞으로 금융 산업에 일대 전환을 불러 현금 없는 사회를 가속화 할 것으로 보인다. / 사진:픽사베이통제 꿈꾸는 당국, 수익 난망 금융권, 신뢰 못 주는 IT의 ‘동상이몽’... 정부 딜레마 뚫고 주도권, 예산 2배 늘리고 규제 풀기로 ‘강공’세계 금융의 허브는 영국이다. 전 세계에 식민지를 개척해 ‘태양이 지지 않는 나라’로 불리며 지난 400년간 세계 금융의 중심지 역할을 했다. 두 차례의 세계대전 이후 패권을 미국에 넘겨줬지만. 영국이 금융 허브로 발돋움한 것은 17세기 왕실이 전쟁 자금을 조달하기 위해 대규모 채권을 발행하면서다. 왕실·상인들 간에 자금조달 체계가 자리 잡았고, 금융은 시스템화한 산업으로 발전하기 시작했다. 19세기 교역 증가와 금본위제 도입 등으로 영국 파운드화는 글로벌 기축통화로 올라섰다. 당시 많은 나라가 영국의 선진적 금융시스템을 배웠고, 런던은 자연스레 전 세계 금융의 중심지로 거듭나게 됐다. 금융은 패권의 상징이며, 돈·사람을 움직이는 일종의 시스템인 것이다.  금융 산업에 변화의 물결이 몰아치고 있다. 금융을 만난 정보기술(IT)이 지급·결제는 물론 대출·투자·보험 등 모든 분야의 이용 방식과 산업 구조의 틀을 바꾸고 있다. 이른바 ‘핀테크(Fintech)’라 불리는 금융산업의 새로운 조류다.  핀테크는 모든 사람이 안전하게, 손쉽고 저렴한 금융서비스를 이용할 수 있게 하는 데 목적이 있다. 정부도 IT 기술에 기반을 둔 금융서비스 및 혁신적 비금융기업이 신기술을 활용해 금융서비스를 제공하는 것이라고 핀테크의 정의를 명시하고 있다. 국가적으로는 자본·인재를 끌어들여 대외 경쟁력을 높이는 일이기도 하다.  그러나 한국은 아직 선도국가가 아니다. 어니스트영(EY)에 따르면 한국의 핀테크 도입률은 2019년 기준 67%에 불과하다. 세계 평균 64%를 조금 웃도는 수준이다. 2017년 32%에 불과했던 것과 비교하면 비약적 발전이지만, IT 강국이라는 타이틀을 고려하면 아직 초라한 수준이다. 한국의 기존 금융시스템은 안정됐고, 이미 깊숙이 자리 잡아 전환하기 어렵다. 핀테크를 둘러싸고 정책당국·금융회사·IT기업 간에 이견이 팽팽하고 도입 속도가 더딘 이유다.  이런 가운데 정부는 2020년을 핀테크 도입의 원년으로 삼고, 본격적으로 핀테크 산업 육성에 나섰다. 정부와 금융권은 4월부터 핀테크 기업에 집중적으로 투자하는 핀테크 혁신펀드를 조성한다. 2023년까지 총 3000억원을 조성하고, 필요에 따라 2025년까지 규모를 5000억원으로 늘릴 방침이다. 올해에만 855억원을 집행한다. 이 펀드는 은행과 금융 유관기관이 참여해 핀테크 기업의 창업 초기 자금과 스케일업·해외 진출 등에 투자한다. 정부는 또 혁신금융서비스 지정을 100개로 늘리는 한편 인수합병(M&A) 활성화, 기술특례상장독려 등을 통해 국내 핀테크 기업들의 스케일업을 도울 계획이다. 권대영 금융위원회 금융혁신기획단장은 지난해 12월 ‘2019 핀테크의 밤’에 참석해 “데이터를 기반으로 한 금융혁신을 가속할 것”이라고 강조하기도 했다.도입률 중국·인도에 20%포인트 뒤진 67%정부가 이처럼 핀테크 대응에 바삐 나선 이유는 금융산업의 세계적 변화가 빨라지고 있어서다. 전 세계적 스마트폰 보급과 정보기술 발달로 금융시스템이 아직 정착되지 않은 중국·인도 등 신흥국의 핀테크 산업이 눈부시게 발전하고 있다.  결여는 필요를 낳고 필요는 혁신으로 이어진다. 동남아시아 신흥국은 은행 계좌를 보유한 사람의 비중이 30% 안팎으로 낮다. 은행의 자금중개 기능이 제대로 작동하지 않아, 국가 자원을 분배하거나 경제성장을 위한 자금 지원이 어려운 실정이다. 저소득층에 무담보 신용대출을 하는 방글라데시 그라민은행 등 마이크로 파이낸스가 등장했지만, 지역 사회 전체로 전파되지는 못했다.  이런 가운데 스마트폰의 등장, 보급은 개인인증 등 금융의 자격증명 및 보안 문제를 해소했다. 은행 서비스를 이용하기 어려운 격오지 거주자들도 은행·보험 서비스를 이용할 수 있게 했다. 특히 지급·결제 방식도 신용카드를 건너뛰고 페이 서비스로 이동하며 미국, 유럽 등 선진국들보다 현금 없는 사회가 빠르게 자리 잡고 있다. 중국과 인도의 핀테크 도입률은 87%(2019년 기준)에 달한다. 이에 비해 금융선진국으로 불렸던 일본은 34%에 그친다.  세계적으로 핀테크 도입 속도가 빨라지고 있어, 이 흐름을 쫓지 않으면 금융 후진국으로 전락할 수도 있다. 이에 한국도 정부와 금융회사, IT 기업들이 뭉쳐 2017년께부터 핀테크 도입에 박차를 가하는 것이다. 당초 정부의 입장은 조심스러웠다. IT는 기존 금융업의 가치사슬을 와해시킬 수 있는 파괴자의 속성을 갖고 있어서다. 예컨대 크라우드펀딩·P2P 대출이 활성화되면, 극단적으로 은행이 사라지게 될지도 모른다. 기존에는 은행이 고객으로부터 받은 예금을 자금이 필요한 곳에 빌려주는 자금중개자 역할을 했는데, 앞으로는 예금자와 대출자가 직접 온라인 공간에서 자금을 거래할 수 있어서다.  중개기관은 부동산처럼 양측 계약을 도와주는 한편, 대출자의 신용 및 사업성 평가를 해주고 수수료를 받는다. e커머스와 지급·결제 영역도 마찬가지다. 네이버·카카오 등 온라인 플랫폼이 커지면, 각사의 페이 서비스가 독자적 화폐 생태계를 갖출 수도 있다.  이런 급진적 변화는 기존 금융시스템의 혼란으로 이어질 수 있다. 금융은 관치산업이다. 관치는 금융회사의 능동적 판단을 가로막고 책임회피 수단으로 악용되지만, 금융시스템 보호 측면에서 불가피한 측면이 있다. 금융회사들의 리스크 관리와 무분별한 대출을 막고, 통화량 관리 등을 통한 경제 정책의 체계적 운용을 위해서도 필요하다.  이 때문에 금융당국은 핀테크 도입에 따른 시스템의 불확실성 고조에 불안감을 갖고 있다. 특히 산업을 관리·통제해야 하는 금융당국으로서는 소수 금융회사가 모든 금융거래를 취급하는 현재 산업구조가 쉽고 용이하다. 그러나 핀테크로 인해 불특정 다수의 자금 대여자와 차입자가 등장하면 통제가 어렵고 관리비용이 증가한다. 금융당국이 핀테크 산업 활성화에 장고한 까닭이기도 하다.P2P·크라우드펀드 잇단 사고로 신뢰 추락금융당국의 이런 불안을 갖게 된 것은 IT기업들이 자초한 측면도 있다. P2P 대출 업체들의 부실한 여신관리가 대표적이다. 금융감독원에 따르면 3월 18일 기준 140개 P2P 기업의 대출 연체율은 15.8%에 달한다. 대출 원금이 1000억원이라면 이 중 158억원의 대출이 이자를 못 갚았다는 뜻이다. 연체율이 100%에 달하는 기업도 8개나 된다. 이에 금융당국은 ‘소비자경보(주의단계)’를 발령했다.  P2P 기업들이 취급하는 상품은 대체로 부동산 리파이낸싱 등 비우량 자산을 기초자산으로 삼는다. 한국P2P금융협회에 따르면 부동산 대출상품만 취급하는 16개 P2P 회사의 평균 연체율은 20.9%에 달한다. 2008년 글로벌 금융위기 직전 저축은행들의 프로젝트파이낸싱(PF) 연체율이 14% 안팎이었던 것과 비교하면 높은 편이다.  연체율이 높은 것뿐만 아니라 실제 투자 실패 사례도 적지 않게 나오고 있다. 국내 P2P 1위 업체 테라펀딩의 경우 3월 세종시 근린생활시설 신축사업에 투자하는 대출상품 30억원이 모두 원금 손실을 일으키기도 했다. 2위 업체 어니스트펀드도 중소기업 매출채권 상품과 김홍도 얼라이브 미디어아트 전시채권 부실 등으로 기록적인 손실을 일으킨 바 있다.  P2P 업체들은 관리 능력이 부족했음에도, 코로나 바이러스 감염증(코로나19) 등 경기 여건의 불확실성을 실패 원인으로 꼽고 책임을 회피하고 있다. 크라우드펀딩 업체들 역시 투자 상품들이 손실을 일으켜도 손실을 줄일 수 있는 방안을 마련하기보다 책임회피에 급급하다.  금융회사는 엄격한 위험 관리로 투자자들의 신뢰를 얻고, 고객 자산을 지켜야 하는 의무를 진다. 이에 비해 크라우드·P2P 등 신생 핀테크 기업은 서비스의 플랫폼을 지향할 뿐, 책임지는 모습을 보이지 않는다.  지난 3월에는 5개 이상의 P2P 업체들이 연 24%의 법정 최고금리를 초과해 이자를 받은 사실이 밝혀지기도 했다. 이들이 차주로부터 받은 플랫폼 수수료에 이자를 합하면서 법정 최고 이자율을 넘긴 것이다. 이와 관련해 서울중앙지방법원은 연 24%를 초과한 수수료는 어떤 명칭이든 모두 이자로 봐야 한다고 판결한 바 있다.은성수 금융위원장은 올해는 핀테크가 결실을 보는 해라며 규제 혁신에 앞장서겠다고 밝혔다. / 사진:연합뉴스  핀테크 회사를 둘러싼 신뢰 문제가 계속해서 터지는 가운데 오래 8월 27일 ‘온라인투자연계금융업 및 이용자 보호에 관한 법률(온투법)’이 시행된다. 온투법 시행으로 P2P 금융이 제도권으로 들어오는 것이다. 그러나 뱅킹 온라인 플랫폼에서 개인 간 거래에서 발생한 사건·사고와 관련해 IT기업들의 책임규명이 명확하지 않다는 문제가 존재한다.  P2P 상품에 투자했다가 손실을 봤다는 한 투자자는 “사실상 P2P 사업자는 대출 부실의 리스크를 거의 지지 않으며, 수수료가 주된 수익이기 때문에 검증되지 않은 상품을 많이 내놓을 가능성도 있다”며 “상품의 부실화를 막고 소비자 피해를 최소화할 수 있는 구조화된 시스템과 P2P 회사에 책임을 물릴 수 있는 제도적 장치가 필요하다”고 주장했다.  한국인터넷진흥원에 따르면 국내 핀테크 기업의 45.1%(2018년 기준)가 자본금 1억원 이상 10억원 미만이다. 1억원 미만도 20.2%에 달한다. 고객이 믿고 돈을 맡기기에는 규모와 역량이 부족한 셈이다.금융권은 정중동, 경쟁력 유지 방안 모색이런 혼란 속에서 기존 금융회사들은 수동적 태도를 견지해왔다. 핀테크를 도입하면 은행의 수익성이 악화해서다. 핀테크는 기존 은행의 수익 모델을 전면 부정하는 분산과 개인 간 거래를 지향한다.  예컨대 해외송금의 경우 고객이 은행에 송금 요청을 하면, 은행이 외환 중개은행에 지급을 요청하고, 외환 중개은행은 해외의 송금 받을 은행에 입금을 통지하고, 해외 은행은 이 돈을 수취인에게 전달하는 4단계 과정을 거친다. 이 과정에서 송금수수료·전신료·중개수수료·수취료 등 네 종류의 수수료가 발생하며, 은행의 수익으로 귀속된다. 그런데 고객이 해외의 수취인에게 1~2단계 만에 송금할 수 있는 핀테크 기술을 적용하면 은행은 해외송금 수수료를 얻지 못하게 된다.  해외송금만이 아니다. 금융지주사가 자사의 신용카드 서비스를 포기하고, 페이를 도입하면 연 수천억 원에 달하는 신용카드 가맹점 수수료를 잃게 된다. 페이 서비스는 높은 가맹점 수수료를 요구하지도, 회원들에게 연회비를 받지도 않는다. IT 플랫폼 기업들은 당장 e커머스 등의 자기 생태계의 확장을 위해 페이 서비스를 도입하고 있다.  이런 핀테크의 거래 간소화와 투명성 향상, 비용 절감 등의 방향은 금융회사의 수익구조와 대치된다. 금융회사들이 그간 핀테크 열풍에 눈 감아왔던 이유다. 이 때문에 금융회사들은 핀테크의 도입 필요성은 인지하면서도, 최대한 그 시기가 지연되길 바랐다. 현재는 금융당국의 교통정리에 몸을 맡긴 상태다. 금융회사는 확고한 오너가 없기 때문에 벌어지는 일이기도 하다.  현재는 금융위원회를 중심으로 한 정책당국이 핀테크의 주도권을 잡고 있다. 금융위는 성장 가능성 있는 스타트업을 집중적으로 육성해 기존 금융회사와 묶어 시스템화하는 방식의 정책을 펼치고 있다.금융위, 스몰 라이선스 등 진입장벽 낮춰 혁신그 첫번째 무대는 규제 샌드박스다. 정부는 지난해 1월 17일 정보통신기술(ICT) 융합을 시작으로 현재까지 227건의 규제 샌드박스를 승인했다. 이 가운데 금융혁신 분야가 102건으로 가장 많다. 샌드박스 안에서 새로운 가치사슬을 창출할 수 있는 기술력과 아이디어를 가진 회사를 실제 시장에 내놔 금융 혁신을 꾀하고 있다.  현재 샌드박스 안에는 KB금융그룹·신한금융지주·하나금융지주 등 국내 주요 금융지주 산하 기업들이 핀테크 기업들과 손잡고 인공지능(AI)·보안·신용분석·P2P 등 분야 서비스 개발에 참여하고 있다. 올 8월 신용정보법을 포함한 데이터3법 개정안이 시행되면 혁신 금융서비스들이 규제 특례 없이 서비스를 개시할 수 있게 된다.  정부가 4월 가동을 시작한 핀테크 혁신 펀드는 스타트업이 수익화 모델을 본격적으로 구현하기 전까지 필요한 자금을 지원해주는 측면도 강하다. 더불어 스몰 라이센스 제도를 통해 복잡한 인허가 절차 없이 핀테크 기업이 금융업이 쉽게 뛰어들 수 있도록 할 계획이다.  영국의 금융시장 시장분석가 크리스 스키너는 그의 책 [디지털뱅크, 은행의 종말을 고하다]에서 은행과 핀테크 산업의 본격적 협업이 이뤄지는 것을 핀테크 발전 단계의 3기 ‘파트너십’으로 정의했다. 현재 한국도 파트너십 단계에 접어든 것으로 보이며, 금융소비자의 생활 패턴도 온라인과 모바일로 이동할 전망이다.  물론 불만도 나온다. 샌드박스 제도 역시 관치의 한계에서 벗어나지 못하며, 선정되지 못한 핀테크 기업들은 독자 생존의 길을 걸어야 한다는 볼멘소리도 나온다. 한 로보어드바이저 개발사 대표는 “규제 샌드박스 기업 선정에 있어 기술력과 비전보다도 금융위 관계자들과의 관계가 많이 작용한다”며 “해외 핀테크 기업의 국내 진출 등에 대비한 전략과 국내 기업의 해외시장 진출 방안도 부족하다”고 지적했다.- 김유경 기자 neo3@joongang.co.kr[정기구독] [콘텐트 구매]				[ⓒ 이코노미스트(jmagazine.joins.com) 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=243&aid=0000009923

2020.05.12.	Joins.com	[트랜D] 핀테크, 테크핀 그리고 빅테크	빅테크 기업이 여는 핀테크의 미래핀테크에서 앞서나가기 위해 필요한 것은?             과거 금융산업은 금융사끼리만 경쟁하던 구조였다. 지점 입점 전략, 금융상품 전략, 마케팅 전략을 통해 은행과 은행, 증권사와 증권사가 경쟁하던 산업이었다. 금융사들만이 영위하던 금융산업에 비금융사들이 진입하기 시작하며 또 다른 경쟁 양상이 벌어지기 시작했다. 금융산업 내에서 은행과 IT기업 혹은 IT기업과 IT기업 사이의 경쟁으로 양상이 바뀐 것이다. 이러한 과정에서 등장한 용어가 핀테크(fintech)와 테크핀(techfin)이다. 핀테크는 금융사가 다양한 금융서비스를 모바일로도 제공하는 움직임이라고 한다면, 테크핀은 정보통신기술(ICT) 기업이 제공하는 다양한 모바일 서비스에 금융서비스도 포함하는 움직임을 뜻한다.     핀테크와 테크핀의 격돌[김광석 제공]      ━   빅 테크 기업의 언번들링      핀테크와 테크핀의 격돌은 소위 빅 테크(Big tech) 기업들이 특정 금융서비스를 기존 금융사들보다 ‘더 잘’ 전달하기 시작하면서 더 크게 부상했다. 특히, ‘GAFA(Google·Amazon·Facebook·Apple)’로 불리는 미국의 빅 테크 기업들과 ‘BAT(Baidu·Alibaba·Tencent)’로 대표되는 중국의 빅 테크 기업들이 독자 기술을 바탕으로 차별화된 금융서비스를 제공하면서, 금융산업이 새롭게 재편되고 있다.      아마존(Amazon)은 기업을 선정해 운용자금을 대출해 주는 ‘Amazon Lending’을 출시하고, 대출 서비스 대상을 개인에서 기업까지 확대하며 본격적으로 금융시장에 진입하기 시작했다. 페이스북(Facebook)의 메신저페이뿐만 아니라, 구글페이, 바이두월넷 등과 같은 지급결제 서비스의 혁신이 두드러졌고, 알리바바(Alibaba)의 마이뱅크와 텐센트(Tencent)의 위뱅크의 은행 서비스 진출은 금융 산업의 지각변동을 예고하는 복선과 같았다. 국내에서도 삼성페이·네이버페이·카카오뱅크 등과 같은 빅 테크 기업의 움직임을 온 국민이 이미 체감하고 있다.        특히, 빅 테크 기업의 주된 특징은 ‘언번들링(Unbundling)’이다. 금융사들이 제공하는 지급결제·대출·자산관리·보험 등에 이르는 모든 금융서비스를 전달(Bundling)하는 것이 아니라, 이를 모두 해체·분리(Undundling)하고 하나의 서비스만 ‘더 잘’ 전달하는 방법이다. 정부는 금융기관에 대해 안정성 규제와 감독 의무를 부과하고 있다. 이 때문에 금융산업은 대표적 규제산업으로 꼽힌다. 빅 테크 기업은 다양한 금융서비스를 언번들링하여 수행함으로써 규제를 회피하고 있다. 이러한 점에서 빅 테크 기업들이 전통 금융기업들보다 규제 측면에서 유리하다. ‘기울어진 운동장’에서 경쟁이 벌어지는 셈이다.           ━   빅 테크 기업들의 경쟁력과 금융산업의 긴장감      빅 테크 기업은 플랫폼 가입자 풀과 기술력을 바탕으로 무점포·비대면 접근이 유리하다는 점에서 상당한 경쟁력이 있다. 기존 금융사가 점포를 활용한 대면 접근을 시도했다는 점에서 차별화가 가능했다. 특히, 소비자들은 비대면 서비스에 대한 편리함과 유용성을 인식하면서 빅 테크 기업들이 제공하는 금융서비스에 대한 의존도가 증대되고 있다. 그뿐만 아니라, 빅 테크 기업들이 플랫폼을 통해 구축한 정형·비정형 데이터는 소비자들에게 실시간으로 맞춤화된 서비스로 활용될 수 있다.         필자는 『미래 시나리오 2021』을 통해서, 선진국을 중심으로 오픈뱅킹이 의무화되고, 규제가 완화되는 과정에서 빅 테크의 금융업 진출이 가속화되고 있음을 보였다. 예를 들어, 유럽연합(EU)에서는 2015년 11월 지급결제 서비스 지침(Payment Service Directive)이 통과되어 소비자의 동의가 있을 경우 면허를 소지한 빅 테크 기업이 기존 은행 망의 지급결제 기록에 접근할 수 있도록 허용했다. 우리나라에서도 2018년 은산분리(산업자본의 은행 지분보유 제한) 대원칙이 완화되면서 인터넷 전문은행에 한정해 IT기업이 은행 산업을 소유(최대 34%)할 수 있게 되었다. 그러나 매년 2차례 대주주 적격성 유지 심사를 받아야 해서 안정적 경영이 어려웠으나, 2020년 5월 들어 '인터넷전문은행 설립 및 운영에 관한 특례법 일부 개정 법률안(인터넷 전문은행법)'이 통과되면서, 2021년에는 빅 테크 기업의 인터넷전문은행 출범이 가속화될 것으로 보인다. P2P 대출산업에 대한 규제도 완화하였고, 2019년 들어 규제샌스박스를 도입하고, 규제자유특구를 지정하는 등 규제여건이 개선되고 있다. 특히, 데이터 3법(개인정보보호법·정보통신망법·신용정보법)도 2020년 1월 9일 국회 본회의를 통과하며 규제가 완화됐다.       빅 테크 기업들은 이미 규모 면에서 세계적인 금융사들을 압도하고 있다. GAFAM(Google·Amazon·Facebook·Apple·Microsoft) 뿐만 아니라, 알리바바와 텐센트도 세계적 금융사를 상회하는 시가총액을 기록하고 있다. 앤트 파이낸셜(Ant Financial)은 알리바바가 설립한 금융사로, 이미 세계적인 금융그룹으로 부상했다. 금융사들도 디지털 선호 고객의 이탈을 방지하기 위해 핀테크 기업들과 파트너십을 확대하고, IT 인재를 영입하고, 연구·개발에 적극적인 투자를 진행하고 있지만, 성장 속도에 한계가 있다.     빅테크 기업과 대형 금융기관의 시가총액 비교[FSB(Financial Stability Board)]     ━   빅 테크 기업들, 어디까지 뻗어 나갈까        빅 테크 기업들은 자사가 보유한 플랫폼의 범용성, 브랜드 인지도, 고객 데이터, ICT 기술력 등을 바탕으로 금융서비스를 지속해서 확대해 나가고 있다. 세계 10대 빅 테크 기업들이 매년 신규로 런칭하는 금융서비스는 지속해서 늘어나고 있으며, 2020~2021년 사이에는 더욱 가파르게 확대될 전망이다. 특히 신용거래와 지급결제 서비스의 증가가 확연하며, 이는 보험과 자산관리 분야로 확대되는 추세다.      10대 빅테크 기업들이 제공하는 금융서비스 추이[Banque de France, FSB(Financial Stability Board)]           빅 테크 기업의 비즈니스 모델이 전통 금융사보다 수익성 측면에서 우수하다는 평가를 받고 있다. 빅 테크 기업의 자기자본이익률(ROE, Return on equity)이 글로벌 은행보다 월등히 높게 나타난다. 금융사들도 지점을 축소하는 등 자산을 경량화해 나가고 있지만, 비대면화 서비스로 수요가 집중되고 있는 속도를 따라가지 못하고 있다. 반면, 무점포·비대면 비즈니스 모델에 기초한 빅 테크 기업들은 디지털 플랫폼을 활용해 소비자들에게 가격 경쟁력 있는 금융서비스를 제공하고 있다. 예를 들어, 금융사들이 위험을 부담해 가며 ‘서류상의’ 저신용자들에게 낮은 금리의 신용대출을 제공할 수 없는 여건이지만, 빅 테크 기업들은 빅데이터를 활용해 채무상환 태도를 평가해 위험을 경감한 채 적정금리의 신용대출을 제공할 수 있다.       빅테크 vs 글로벌 은행, 자기자본이익률(ROE, Return on equity) 비교[Bloomberg, Reuters, Gurufocus, FSB(Financial Stability Board)]           중국은 빅 테크 기업들의 금융 진출이 가장 활발한 나라로 꼽힌다. 알리페이와 텐센트는 각각 중국 결제 서비스 시장의 53.8%와 38.9%를 점유하고 있다(2018년 4분기 기준). 이러한 강세를 기반으로 인터넷 전문은행 시장도 텐센트의 위뱅크와 알리바바의 마이뱅크가 각각 1, 2위를 기록하고 있다. 위 뱅크는 주로 SNS 상에서 이용자의 행동 패턴과 관련된 빅데이터를 활용해 신용도를 평가하고, 마이뱅크는 중소 상공인들의 영업 데이터를 활용한다. 최근 빅 테크 기업들은 금융의 탈중앙화(De-Fi; Decontralized Finance)를 추진하고 있다. 대부분의 금융 서비스는 금융 기관의 인프라 및 네트워크를 활용해야만 했기 때문에, 빅 테크 기업들도 금융사와 협업이 중요했다. 하지만 빅 테크 기업들은 블록체인을 활용해 중앙화된 금융기관의 역할을 배제하려는 도전에 나서고 있다. 블록체인의 스마트 계약(Smart Contract) 기술을 활용해 송금·외환·신용거래 등의 금융 서비스를 탈중앙화해 나가고 있다. 대표적인 예로, 페이스북은 암호자산 리브라(Libra) 발행 프로젝트를 추진하고 있는데, 은행 계좌 없이도 블록체인 기반으로 송금과 결제가 가능한 모델을 구현하고 있다.     ━   데이터 경제, 디지털 전환을 선도하라       디지털 전환을 선도하는 국가가 되려면 정책적 방향이 안정돼야 한다. 데이터 3법 개정을 통해 다양한 산업에서 빅데이터를 활용할 수 있는 데이터 경제에 진입했다. 강력한 규제들은 국내에서 기업 경영을 꺼리게 하여 오프쇼링(해외 생산기지 이동)을 자극하거나, 리쇼어링(생산기지 본국 회귀)을 어렵게 만든다.      변화하는 환경에 걸맞은 정책과 제도 정비가 시급하다. 경쟁력 있는 빅 테크 기업과 금융사가 육성된다면, 기술서비스 및 금융서비스 수출을 통해 한국 경제성장에 기여하고 세계적으로 영향력을 확대해 나갈 수 있다. 한편, 빅 테크 산업의 성장으로 금융 안정을 저해하지 않도록 해야 한다. 저신용자에게 무분별하게 신용이 제공되면 가계부실이라는 부메랑을 맞게 된다. 빅 테크 기업과 경쟁이 심화함에 따라 기존 금융사의 수익성이 악화하고, 위험도가 높은 금융서비스를 제공과 금융 부실로 이어질 가능성도 크다.      나아가 빅데이터 해킹 및 보안 위협에 대한 대책 마련도 병행해야 한다. 기업이 사이버 보안 역량을 갖출 수 있도록 가이드라인을 제공해야 하겠다. 한국경제산업연구원 경제연구실장 김광석    ▶ 그래서, 팩트가 뭐야? 궁금하면 '팩플'▶ 내 돈 관리는 '그게머니' / 중앙일보 가기ⓒ중앙일보(https://joongang.co.kr), 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=025&aid=0002999893
2020.05.21.	코리아중앙데일리	How to use the SDR	Jim O’Neill   Jim O’Neill, a former chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management and a former UK Treasury Minister, is chair of Chatham House.     Domenico Lombardi    Domenico Lombardi, a former director of the Global Economy Program at the Center for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), is CEO of Fintech Global Advisory.         Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the IMF estimates that, between now and the end of 2021, global GDP will suffer a cumulative loss of more than $9 trillion — a figure greater than the size of the Japanese and German economies combined. While the ultimate solution to the crisis will depend on the development and widespread deployment of diagnostics, treatments and eventually a vaccine, there has also been a proliferation of proposals for containing the pandemic’s economic fallout.    With governments intervening on a massive scale, debt is expected to rise to unprecedented levels in some countries. Italy’s debt-to-GDP ratio, for example, is projected to increase by at least 20 percentage points, to over 155 percent, by the end of the year. Along similar lines, other countries severely hit by the pandemic, like France and Spain, will also experience a sizable spike in their debt-to-GDP ratios. And many developing countries will find themselves in an even worse situation as their access to international capital markets becomes more constrained. With limited reserves in international currencies, they will be less able to purchase goods and services, including life-saving medical supplies.    Accordingly, the global debate has shifted toward proposals to create or mobilize new resources. Some commentators have called for an issuance of the IMF’s reserve asset, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), in order to ensure international liquidity. To that end, the Financial Times suggests that at least $1.37 trillion worth of SDRs would be appropriate. As high as that number may sound, it is actually rather small compared to the unconventional measures enacted by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in recent weeks, not to mention the asset purchases made by all Group of 7 central banks in March alone.    SDRs represent a potential claim on the IMF’s usable currencies and are allocated to sovereign member countries through their fiscal agents — typically, national central banks — in proportion to their respective shares (or “quotas”) in the institution’s capital base. With 3.17 percent of the IMF’s capital base, Italy would be eligible to receive $43 billion from a $1.37 trillion issue. For context, that figure is higher than the resource envelope that the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) would be lending to Italy through a formal rescue program.   Contrary to what was expected at their inception in 1969, SDRs have played a very limited role in the international monetary system. All told, SDRs have been used only four times, most recently in response to the 2008 financial crisis, when the IMF issued approximately $250 billion worth. As a result, SDRs in recent years have accounted for no more than 3 percent of world non-gold monetary reserves.    There is some uncertainty about how a new issue of SDRs would be used to mobilize additional finance and narrow the widening funding gap generated by the pandemic. We propose a simple scheme in which a country would stow its allocation as “equity” in an emergency vehicle, thereby avoiding the need to accrue higher net liabilities on its treasury’s balance sheet. Through the “equity” conferred to the vehicle, the sovereign borrower (the Italian government, in our example) would then attract further capital through bond issuances.      Assuming a very conservative financial leverage ratio of one-to-five, this would increase Italy’s overall financial capacity from $43 billion to $215 billion — a figure that is close to the entire lending capacity earmarked to the ESM for fighting the pandemic. Moreover, this additional capacity would be unencumbered by the typical forms of conditionality that multilateral lenders impose on borrowing countries.    To be sure, in the current climate of uncertainty, investors may be hesitant to subscribe to the vehicle’s issuance. But in the case of a pandemic-devastated country like Italy, the ECB could potentially step in to purchase some non-negligible portion of the bonds.    Eurozone countries could pool their “equities” by setting up a joint vehicle. This would translate into a higher rating and lower cost for the issuance, while facilitating any ECB intervention in purchasing the bonds.    Other reserve-strong countries, such as the United States or China, could spend part of their own SDR allocations on the remaining lot. In effect, these countries would be exchanging SDRs for euros, thus creating an open position in SDRs on which they would be charged indefinitely at current money market rates, which are practically nil. Better yet, these countries would actually benefit from the interest rate accruing to the bond. Hence, an investment in solidarity would yield positive returns from a non-negligible interest-rate differential.      To be sure, any SDR allocation would require the support of at least 85 percent of the IMF’s membership, which means that the United States, with its 17.45 percent quota, would wield veto power. But there is no good reason why the United States would want to use it. The pandemic is generating an unprecedented contraction in the global economy, not to mention its immense costs in human lives. And besides, our proposed method of deploying SDRs would not require U.S. taxpayer money, nor would it pose a challenge to the international status of the dollar.    A stable and healthy global economy is in the U.S. national interest. And in an election year, it is particularly in the interest of a certain incumbent leader.	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=110&oid=640&aid=0000000571
2020.06.01.	매경인터넷	[경영칼럼] 은행 고객 숨은 유출 막으려면 강력한 디지털 서비스만이 답	시중은행 고객 이탈 현상이 가시화하고 있다. 베인앤드컴퍼니가 최근 전 세계 22개국 금융 소비자 13만명을 대상으로 조사한 결과다. 시중은행 대비 탁월한 디지털 역량으로 무장한 핀테크(fintech)·빅테크(bigtech) 기업들이 제공하는 ‘혁신적 금융 서비스’가 고객들을 매료시키고 있기 때문이다.이런 고객 유출은 얼른 봐서는 눈에 잘 띄지 않는다. 정부의 예금자 보호조치 등의 혜택 때문에 여전히 많은 고객이 주거래은행 예금계좌를 유지하고 있기 때문이다. 그러나 예금계좌 외 신용카드, 주택담보대출, 자금 이체 등의 영역에서 고객이 주거래은행이 아닌 경쟁사를 이용하는 경우가 적지 않다. 고객이 몰려가는 곳은 소비자 중심 디지털 생태계를 성공적으로 구축한 기업들이다. 예를 들어 인도에서 최근 1년간 페이티엠(Paytm)을 사용한 경험이 있다고 밝힌 응답자 비중은 75%에 달했다. 또한 중국 응답자 중 70% 이상이 알리페이(Alipay)를 이용하는 것으로 나타났다.그렇다면 시중은행은 고객의 숨은 이탈을 막기 위해 어떤 방법을 고민해야 할까.첫째, 지점 방문이나 콜센터 전화가 불필요할 정도로 강력한 디지털 운영 시스템을 갖춰야 한다. 경쟁력 있는 디지털 고객 경험을 제공하면 높은 고객 충성도가 선물로 따라온다. 영국을 대표하는 선도은행인 RBS(Royal Bank of Scotland)는 신규 주택담보대출의 약 90%를 무서류(paperless) 프로세스로 전환했다. 무서류 프로세스를 통해 RBS는 대출 건당 약 70페이지 분량의 서류 작업을 감축했고, 대출 신청 소요시간(time to close)을 23일에서 11일로 절반 가까이 단축시킴으로써 상당한 수준의 비용 절감 효과를 달성했다. 이보다 훨씬 중요한 점은 과거 서류 기반 프로세스와 비교 시, 고객 NPS(Net Promoter Score·충성도가 높은 고객을 얼마나 많이 보유했는지 나타내는 지표)가 30%나 증가했다는 점이다. 자연히 고객 유출은 줄어들었고, 매출액은 상승했다. 리테일 뱅킹 산업에서 고객 충성도 증가가 의미하는 바는 매우 크다. 충성도가 높은 고객은 그렇지 않은 고객보다 많은 상품을 주거래은행에서 구입하는 경향을 보인다. 다시 말해 고객이 경쟁 금융기관으로 이탈할 가능성이 낮아진다는 의미다.둘째, 다양한 이종산업 선도업체들과의 파트너십을 바탕으로 새로운 금융 생태계를 조성해야 한다. 영국 냇웨스트(Natwest)가 대표적 사례다. 이 은행은 부동산 가치평가, 공과금 정보, 이사·청소 서비스 등을 제공하는 파트너들과 주택 구매 희망자들을 연결하는 디지털 플랫폼 ‘홈 에이전트(Home Agent)’를 출시해 고객들의 높은 호응을 이끌어냈다. 싱가포르 선도은행인 DBS 또한 파트너와 함께 싱가포르 최대 규모 자동차 직거래 마켓플레이스를 구축, 운영 중이다. 이와 같이 고객 관점에서 확장적으로 정의된 신규 플랫폼을 제공함으로써, 은행은 고객 만족도를 높이고 전통적인 핵심 상품인 주택담보대출(모기지론), 자동차담보대출(오토론)에서 실적을 끌어올렸다.

2020.03.06.	디지털데일리	코로나19, 핀테크 스타트업 해외 영업에 영향…비대면 등 대응책 분주	[디지털데일리 이상일기자] 코로나19 여파가 국내 핀테크 스타트업들의 해외 영업에 서서히 영향을 미치고 있다. 한국 방문객 입국을 거부하는 국가가 늘어나면서 출장 등 물리적 인력이동이 어려워진 탓이다. 이에 따라 업계는 비대면채널 활용 등 자구책 마련에 나서고 있다.5일 정부에 따르면 한국발 여행객의 입국을 금지하거나 제한하는 국가가 총 92개국으로 증가했다. 입국 전 14일 내 한국 등을 방문한 외국인 입국을 금지하는 국가 총 38개국으로 늘어났다. 우리나라 국민에 대한 입국 금지 및 제한조치가 확산되며 글로벌 시장을 대상으로 마케팅과 영업을 전개중인 핀테크 업체들의 운신폭도 점차 좁아지고 있다. 액센츄어(Accenture)의 핀테크 스타트업과 주요 금융기관을 한곳에 모아 운영하는 멘토쉽 프로그램인 ‘핀테크 이노베이션 랩(Fintech Innovation Lab)’에 합류해 런던에서 육성 프로그램에 참여하고 있는 차세대 인증 관련 스타트업 센스톤도 현지 미팅에 어려움을 겪고 있다. 자사의 글로벌 비즈니스 헤드쿼터 ‘swIDch’ 영국법인을 통해, 영업을 전개하고 있기도 한 센스톤 유창훈 대표는 “현재 런던에서 자가 격리 중”이라며 “프랑스 리옹 출장도 취소되는 등 유럽에서의 일정차질이 빚어지고 있다”고 전했다.유 대표는 “2주간 자가 격리가 강제사항은 아니지만 자가 격리를 하지 않고 미팅에 나가면 저어하는 분위기가 있다. 또, 지난주 금요일은 아침 10시 미팅이 있었는데, 파트너 쪽에서 9시가 넘어서 미팅을 취소하자고 해 느낌이 우리가 한국 사람들이라 피한 것 같아 컨콜로 하자니까 바로 다시 미팅을 잡아주기도 했다“고 전했다. 센스토은 지금 액센츄어(accenture) 글로벌에서 진행하는 프로그램 기간으로 여러 비즈니스 이벤트들이 많은데, 큰 오프라인 이벤트는 취소하고 대부분의 미팅은 컨퍼런스콜로 진행하고 있다.유 대표는 “업무가 마비된 것은 아니지만 순조롭지도 않다. 일단 대면 미팅이 안 되는 것이 가장 크다. 영국 현지 금융권이나 정부 기관 몇 곳은 일반팀과 비상팀 업무 분리해 비상시 업무가 유지 될 수 있게 완전히 분리된 2팀으로 업무를 진행하고 비상팀 소속은 현재 업무량을 줄인 대신 외부인사(특히 가족 포함, 위험지역 출장자 나 방문자) 절대 교류 금지령을 내린 상황”이라고 전했다. 한편 유 대표는 “지난주까지는 아시아인들에 대한 유럽인들의 눈총이 있었다면, 지금은 이탈리아로부터 시작된 유럽확산으로 두루 경계를 한다는 점이 다르다”고 덧붙였다.인도에 진출한 국내 핀테크 스타트업 밸런스히어로도 업무상 인도 출장이 필요한 자에 한에서 진행하던 출장 등이 일단 보류된 상황이다. 밸런스히어로는 한 달에 평균 10~20명의 직원이 인도를 왕래해 왔다. 다만 밸런스히어로 측은  “이미 인도에서만 사업을 하다 보니 서비스 초기부터 인도와의 물리적인 장벽을 해소하기 위해 업무 메신저 Slack, 온라인 협업 툴 줌, 위키, 제플린 등으로 인도에 있는 직원들과 함께 실시간으로 소통하며 근무하는데 익숙하다”고 밝혔다. 신한금융의 스타트업 육성 프로그램인 ‘신한퓨처스랩’도 지난 2016년 베트남 호치민에 ‘신한퓨처스랩 베트남’을 설치하고 국내 스타트업의 진출을 지원하고 있다. 다만 지난 2월 선발한 6기 육성 기업 중 베트남 진출을 염두에 두고 선발한 4개 기업은 아직 베트남 현지에 가지 못한 상황이다. 퓨처스랩 관계자는 “출장 프로그램이 코로나19로 연기됐다”며 “상황이 진정될 때 까지 일단 베트남에 선발기업이 가는 것은 보류한 상태”라고 전했다. 한편 산업통상자원부(장관 성윤모)는 코로나19로 외국의 한국발 입국제한 조치 등으로 위축된 수출기업의 마케팅을 지원하기 위해 ▲화상상담회 지원 확대, ▲온라인 전시관 신설, ▲긴급 해외 현지 마케팅 대행을 집중 지원키로 했다. 이를 위해, KOTRA 지방지원단 및 해외 중점무역관에 화상상담 소프트웨어를 16개에서 50개로 확대하고 화상상담 전용부스도 확대를 추진해 지역 중소기업들이 보다 쉽게 많은 해외바이어와 화상상담을 진행하도록 했다. <이상일 기자>2401@ddaily.co.kr뉴스채널 설정 - 네이버 메인에서 디지털데일리 뉴스를 볼 수 있어요.IT정보의 즐거운 업그레이드[딜라이트닷넷]<저작권자 © 디지털데일리 무단전재-재배포금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=105&oid=138&aid=0002083469
2020.03.09.	뉴시스	'코로나19'에 혁신금융 서면 심사…"규제 샌드박스 차질없이 운영"	[서울=뉴시스] 정옥주 기자 = 금융위원회·금융감독원·핀테크지원센터는 '신종 코로나바이러스 감염증(코로나19)' 확산에도 금융규제 샌드박스 제도가 중단없이 운용되도록 혁신금융심사위원회 서면 운영, 핫라인 구축등을 추진한다고 9일 밝혔다.먼저 혁신금융심사위원회를 서면으로 운영한다. 당초 올해 제2차 혁신금융심사위원회가 지난 2일 개최될 예정이었지만, 코로나19 확산에 따라 심사일정을 연기했다. 금융위는 혁신금융서비스의 심사 및 지정 일정이 지연되는 경우 핀테크기업 등의 사업화 추진에 어려움이 있을 수 있어, 차기 위원회는 빠른 시일 내 서면으로 열고 신청 서비스에 대한 심사를 진행하기로 했다. 또 코로나19 진행상황을 예의주시하며, 필요시 추후 혁신금융심사위원회도 서면으로 개최하는 방안을 검토 중이다.혁신금융심사위원회 운영 등에 관한 규정은 혁신금융심사위원회 위원장이 불가피하다고 인정할 경우, 의안을 서면으로 의결할 수 있도록 하고 있다.금융당국과 혁신금융사업자간 핫라인도 구축한다. 긴급상황 발생시 혁신금융사업자와 원스톱으로 소통할 수 있도록 핫라인(fintech@fss.or.kr, 02-3145-7131)을 구축해 안내한다. 또 일정에 맞춰 서비스가 출시될 수 있도록 지원하고 불필요한 부담이 발생하지 않도록 필요한 조치를 한다. 이달 서비스 출시예정인 기업 6개사와 경과보고서 제출 예정인 9개사를 확인한 결과, 아직까지 출시 및 제출에 별다른 문제는 없는 것으로 파악됐다. 혁신금융서비스의 모니터링도 강화한다. 핀테크기업의 경우 소규모 인력, 금융업무에 대한 경험부족 등으로 재택근무 상황, 사업장 폐쇄, 전산 장애 등 발생시 혁신금융서비스 제공에 차질이 발생할 우려가 있다.이에 금융위는 혁신금융사업자의 긴급상황 발생에 대비한 대응방안을 자율적으로 마련할 수 있도록 하고, 특히 일반 금융소비자를 대상으로 서비스를 개시한 핀테크기업 20개사에 대해선 대응방안 마련에 필요한 컨설팅을 추진키로 했다.이밖에 샌드박스를 준비 중인 기업의 비대면 컨설팅을 확대한다. 기존 대면 컨설팅 인력이 유선·이메일 상담도 진행하도록 하고, 핀테크지원센터 홈페이지의 질의응답(Q&A)을 적극 활용할 수 있도록 안내한다.☞공감언론 뉴시스 channa224@newsis.com▶ K-Artprice 오픈! 미술작품 가격을 공개합니다▶ 뉴시스 빅데이터 MSI 주가시세표 바로가기 <ⓒ 공감언론 뉴시스통신사. 무단전재-재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=003&aid=0009745999

2020.01.29.	조선일보	창업 7전8기… 150만명 자산 관리하는 사나이	[차세대 유니콘을 찾아서] 자산관리 레이니스트 김태훈 대표 이직 중개·법안 분석 등 시도하다 1년에 한번꼴로 서비스 갈아엎어 자산 한데 모은 뱅크샐러드 시작 "모든 데이터 관리 서비스 만들것"'이직(移職) 중개 서비스, 총선 공약 분석, 국회의원 법안 투표 분석, 신용카드 추천 서비스, 가계부 관리 서비스….'자산관리 서비스 스타트업 레이니스트를 만든 김태훈(35) 대표가 과거에 도전했다가 접거나 통합한 사업들이다. 지난달 27일 서울 여의도 사무실에서 만난 그는 "남들은 일곱 번 넘어졌다고 하지만 난 더 나은 서비스를 위한 개선 과정이었다"며 "1년에 한 번 꼴로 서비스를 갈아엎고 지금까지 여덟 번째 시도한 결과가 지금의 뱅크샐러드 앱"이라고 말했다. '7전 8기' 자체가 창업 과정이었다는 설명이다.뱅크샐러드는 다운로드 600만건, 월평균 150만명이 이용하는 서비스로 성장했다. 뱅크샐러드가 관리하는 자산은 180조원이 넘는다. 지금까지 레이니스트는 620억원 넘는 투자금을 유치하면서 기업가치 3000억원의 스타트업으로 성장했다. 유니콘(기업가치 1조원 이상의 비상장 스타트업)으로 성장도 멀지 않았다.◇창업을 꿈꾼 대학생김 대표는 대학생 때부터 취업 대신 창업을 꿈꿨다고 한다. 서강대 경영학과 4학년이던 2012년 6월 레이니스트를 창업했다. 그해 10월 처음으로 모바일 메신저 카카오톡에 기반한 직장인 이직 연결 서비스를 내놨다. 직장 위치·직종·근속 연수 등을 채팅방에서 공유하고, 적절한 일자리를 알아봐 주는 식이다. 시장 반응은 없었다. 같은 해 대선을 앞두고 대선 후보자 공약 데이터를 분석해 자신에게 맞는 후보를 추천해주는 서비스도 내놨다. 신기하다는 반응은 있었지만, 선거철이 아니면 무용지물이었고, 시장성이 없어 또다시 실패했다.지난달 27일 서울 여의도 사무실에서 만난 김태훈 레이니스트 대표는 “금융뿐만 아니라 개인의 모든 데이터를 개인 스스로 관리·분석할 수 있는 서비스를 만들겠다”고 말했다. /김연정 객원기자김 대표는 2014년에 지출 내역과 카드 혜택을 분석해 맞춤형 카드를 추천해주는 서비스로 자산관리앱 뱅크샐러드를 내놨다. 하지만 사용자 금융 데이터 수집이 난관이었다. 정부와 금융권은 "민감한 개인 금융 정보를 이름도 모르는 기업에 내줄 수 없다"고 했다. 김 대표는 카드사·은행이 고객에게 보낸 지출 내역 문자메시지를 앱에서 일일이 긁어오는 방식으로 데이터를 모았다. 그는 "카드를 보기만 해도 연회비, 주요 혜택, 할인처를 줄줄 외웠을 정도였다"고 말했다.2017년 새로운 서비스를 내놓으면서 상황이 바뀌었다. 문자메시지 대신 사용자의 동의를 얻어 은행·카드·증권사 등에서 예금·대출·주식·보험 등 모든 금융 데이터를 직접 수집하는 방식(스크래핑)으로 전환한 것이다. 금융권에서는 여전히 "금융 데이터를 불법으로 수집하는 것"이라고 반대했지만, 사용자는 지출·투자·보험까지 한눈에 보여주는 서비스를 선호했고, 이런 시장 반응은 정부·금융권 인식까지 바꿔놨다. 금융위원회는 뱅크샐러드 같은 서비스를 '마이데이터' 신(新)산업으로 규정했고, 은행·카드·증권사도 데이터를 개방했다. 레이니스트는 뱅크샐러드의 카드 추천 서비스로만 연간 수십억원의 중개 수수료를 받고 있다.◇"금융 넘어 데이터 혁신 기업으로"김 대표가 일곱 번 실패하면서도 줄곧 도전해 온 서비스의 근간은 '데이터(data)'였다. 그는 "레이니스트는 그동안 급격한 변화를 겪은 것처럼 보이지만 딱 하나 데이터에 집중해왔다"며 "데이터로 사용자가 가장 많은 혜택을 볼 수 있는 분야가 금융이라고 판단했다"고 말했다.김 대표는 올해 새로운 변화를 준비하고 있다. 4월쯤 앱을 전면 개편할 계획이다. 그는 "1~2년 전만 해도 고객 자산을 한눈에 볼 수 있도록 관리해주는 서비스는 우리뿐이었지만 지금은 토스·오픈뱅킹 등 다양한 서비스가 나왔다"며 "경쟁도 그만큼 심해졌고, 우리는 또다시 변신해야 한다"고 말했다.그는 어떤 방향으로 개편할지에 대해서는 말하지 않았다. 하지만 개인의 일생을 데이터로 관리·분석할 수 있도록 하는 것이 주요 내용이다. 건강 관련 데이터를 한눈에 볼 수 있도록 모아 사용자의 질병·건강상태 등을 관리해 주는 헬스케어가 대표적 분야다.그는 "지금까지 뱅크샐러드는 한국 대표 핀테크(fintech·금융과 기술의 합성어) 서비스로 알려졌지만, 이제는 핀테크를 넘어 다른 영역으로도 확장할 것"이라며 "이를 통해 한국을 대표하는 데이터 기업으로 발돋움하겠다"고 말했다.[강동철 기자 charley@chosun.com] 		[네이버 메인에서 조선일보 받아보기]		[조선닷컴 바로가기]		[조선일보 구독신청하기] 	- Copyrights ⓒ 조선일보 & chosun.com, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지 -	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=023&aid=0003503589

"젊은이들 모습에서 20년 전 나를 보았다."마윈뿐 아니라 마이크로소프트 사티아 나델라, 페이스북 마크 저커버그, 구글 순다르 피차이, 트위터 잭 도시 등 쟁쟁한 정보 기술(IT) 기업 CEO들이 최근 앞다퉈 아프리카를 찾아 투자 기회를 노리고 있다. 아프리카에 몰린 벤처 투자금은 지난해 총 20억2000만달러로, 5년 전의 10배 수준으로 급증했다. 세계 최빈국이 몰린 아프리카에서 어떤 일이 벌어지고 있는 걸까. 사회적 기업 취업을 준비하는 나는 새로운 디지털 기술이 저개발국을 어떻게 바꾸는지에 관심이 많다. 그 현장을 보려고 케냐행(行) 비행기에 올랐다.◇적선도 핀테크로 할 수 있는 나라, 케냐케냐에 도착한 날 수도 나이로비 거리를 오가다 빈민 가족과 마주쳤다. 그들은 "배가 너무 고프다"며 손을 내밀었다. 현금이 없어 도와주기 어렵다고 했더니 내 손에 들린 휴대전화를 가리키며 말했다. "엠페사(M-Pesa)로 주면 되잖아요!" 엠페사는 케냐 통신사 사파리콤에서 운영하는 모바일 결제·송금 서비스다. 통신사에서 가상 계좌인 '핀(FIN) 번호'를 받아 여기에 돈을 입금해 쓴다. 앱을 켜고 1달러를 보냈다. 적선(積善)마저 핀테크로 가능한 나라 케냐에 왔음을 실감했다.오동운(오른쪽) 탐험 대원이 케냐 나이로비에서 만난 한 빈민 가족에게 모바일 송금 서비스 엠페사를 이용해 1달러를 적선하고 있다. /표태준 기자케냐는 1인당 국민소득이 2000달러 정도인 빈국이다. 하지만 휴대전화 기반의 핀테크(fintech·금융과 기술의 결합)만큼은 한국을 비롯해 그 어느 개발국보다 앞서 있다. 케냐 인구의 93%가 엠페사를 쓰고 하루 평균 결제가 약 3000만건 이뤄진다. 은행 계좌는 필요 없다. 휴대전화 번호가 곧 계좌 역할을 한다. 케냐 어디서든 볼 수 있는 6.6㎡짜리 구멍가게에서도 결제는 엠페사로 한다. 얼마 전 세상을 뜬 '혁신 전도사' 클레이턴 크리스텐슨 하버드대 교수는 책 '번영의 역설'에서 엠페사를 '시장을 창출하는 혁신'의 대표 사례로 극찬했다.시토요 로포코이위트 엠페사 최고재무책임자(CFO)는 역설적이게도 "케냐가 워낙 엉망이었기 때문에 핀테크가 빠르게 발전할 수 있었다"고 했다. "기반 시설 부족이 '단계를 건너뛴 혁신'으로 이어졌다 생각합니다. 은행이 매우 적어 휴대전화를 활용한 새로운 금융 서비스 수요가 매우 컸지요. 휴대전화는 왜 그렇게 많아졌느냐고요? 이유는 비슷해요. 그 전까지 전화선 보급률이 1%도 안 됐거든요." 금융 기반 시설은 탄탄한 반면 촘촘한 금융 규제 때문에 핀테크가 더디게 발달한 한국과 정반대였다.◇스타트업 창업하는 아프리카 젊은이들사바나밸리의 탄탄한 기반은 '치타 세대'라는, 스마트폰·인터넷에 익숙하고 소비 성향이 큰 20·30대 청년들이다. 40세 이하 연령층이 케냐 인구의 87%를 차지한다. 아프리카개발은행은 아프리카의 청년층(15~35세)이 2050년까지 약 24억명으로 늘어나 세계 전체 인구의 4분의 1을 차지하리라고 전망한다. 선진국이 출산율 저하로 늙어가고 있을 때, 아프리카에선 모바일 기기에 익숙한 젊은이가 대거 양성되고 있다는 뜻이다.이런 청년들은 몸소 겪은 인프라 부족을 발판 삼아 혁신적 스타트업을 만들어내는 중이다. 지난해 '마윈 공익 기금'은 나이지리아 스타트업 라이프뱅크를 최고 벤처기업으로 선정했다. 교통·의료 기반 시설이 부족한 아프리카에 오토바이, 무인 항공기(드론)를 이용한 혈액 배달 서비스를 제공했다는 점을 높게 평가했다. 택시 교통사고가 잦은 르완다에서는 스타트업 세이프모터스가 택시 기사의 속도와 가속도, 위치 정보(GPS)를 분석해 등급을 매기는 서비스를 내놓았다. 남아프리카공화국 스타트업 와이포 와이어리스파워는 드론이 지속적으로 자율 비행할 수 있는 무선 충전기를 개발하기도 했다.나이로비 케냐타대에서 '치타'들(모두 22세)을 만나 이야기를 들었다. "케냐엔 학교가 없는 시골 마을이 많아요. 하지만 이제 전국 어디서든 스마트폰만 있으면 작은 학교가 되지요."(누히아) "엄마는 옷 장사를 해요. 예전엔 사는 곳에서만 장사할 수 있었죠. 이제는 엠페사로 보증금을 받아서 옷을 만든 다음 아주 멀리 사는 사람에게도 팔아요."(하다사) "어머니는 선생님인데 부업을 시작했어요. 앱을 활용해 승용차를 안 쓸 때 이를 다른 사람에게 빌려줘요. 덕분에 소득이 늘었지요."(데니스)기술 발전은 인간 소외와 사회 분열을 촉발한다는 우려가 많이 나온다. 하지만 내가 본 아프리카에선 디지털 기술이 소외 계층을 끌어올리고, 경제에 활력을 불어넣고 있었다. "기술이 세상을 더 좋아지게 만든다." 막연했던 이 말이 아프리카에선 이미 현실이었다.[나이로비=오동운 탐험대원] [취재 동행=표태준 기자 pyotaejun@chosun.com] 		[네이버 메인에서 조선일보 받아보기]		[조선닷컴 바로가기]		[조선일보 구독신청하기] 	- Copyrights ⓒ 조선일보 & chosun.com, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지 -	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=023&aid=0003508686
2020.03.16.	ZDNet Korea	홍콩, 인터넷은행 시대 개막…첫 가상은행 시운영	자뱅크 최초로 시운영 돌입...코로나19로 '비접촉' 금융 가속화(지디넷코리아=유효정  기자)홍콩에서 디지털 은행 시대가 본격 개막됐다.스다이차이징에 따르면 홍콩에서 8개 '가상은행(virtual bank)'이 내부 테스트와 시운영 단계에 들어섰다. 이중 '자뱅크(ZA BANK)'가 홍콩 최초로 가상은행 시범 운영을 시작했다.홍콩 금융당국의 정의에 따르면 가상은행은 '인터넷 혹은 다른 디지털 방식으로 비(?)실물은행, 즉 물리적 없이 은행 서비스를 제공하는 은행'이다.홍콩 금융당국은 홍콩의 가상은행이 중국 대륙 등지에서 운영되는 일반적 인터넷 은행보다 더 강점을 가졌다고 설명하고 있다. 기존 인터넷은행은 모든 은행업무를 대체할 순 없지만, 홍콩의 가상은행은 이를 가능케 해 잠재력이 더 크다고 설명했다. 은행 전체를 가상으로 운영하겠단 시도다.여기에 이번 '코로나19' 사태로 '비접촉식' 은행의 필요성이 커지고 있는 만큼 이번 가상은행뿐 아니라 기존 은행 시스템의 디지털화 역시 가속화할 것으로 전망됐다.홍콩의 가상은행은 은행의 모든 기능에 대한 디지털 구현을 목표로 한다. (사진=원커넥트)홍콩은 앞서 지난해 3월, 4월과 5월 세 차례에 걸쳐 8개의 가상은행 면허(허가증)를 발급했다.이 8개의 기업은 리비VB(Livi VB Limited), SC 디지털솔루션(SC digital Solutions Limited), 자뱅크, 위랩디지탈(Welab Digital), 앤트SME서비스(Ant SME Services Hong Kong Limited), 퓨전뱅크(Fusion Bank), 인사이트핀테크(Insight Fintech), 원커넥트(ONECONNECT)다.이중 앤트SME서비스는 알리바바 산하, 퓨전뱅크는 텐센트 산하, 인사이트핀테크는 샤오미 산하 기업으로 중국 알리바바, 텐센트, 샤오미 등 IT 기업이 홍콩의 가상은행 산업에 대거 참여한 셈이다. 원커넥트는 핑안보험으로 잘 알려진 중국 금융그룹 핑안그룹의 연계 회사다.홍콩 금융당국의 '가상은행 인가(허가) 가이드'에 따르면 은행과 금융 혹은 IT기업이 홍콩에서 가상은행 운영을 신청할 수 있게 했다. 핀테크 기업과 비(非)은행 기업이 은행업에 뛰어들 수 있도록 한 것이다.금융 산업에서 은행의 경쟁을 촉발하고 핀테크 산업을 발전시키겠다는 홍콩 당국의 의지가 녹아있다.이달 본격 시운영 단계에 들어서면서 정식 운영에 앞서 최종 점검이 이뤄질 전망이다.이들 가상은행은 인공지능(AI), 빅데이터, 클라우드컴퓨팅, 모바일인터넷, 5G, 사물인터넷, 블록체인 등 기술을 이용해 고객모집과 투자 및 상품설계, 운영, 대출 등 은행의 모든 서비스를 제공한다.홍콩 정부는 가상은행이 원가와 효율의 강점을 가지면서 기존 은행 시스템 보다 선진화된 시스템이 될 것으로 기대하고 있다.유효정 기자(hjyoo@zdnet.co.kr) ▶ 지디넷코리아 '홈페이지' ▶ 네이버 채널 구독하기[Copyrightⓒ메가뉴스 & ZDNet & CNET. 무단전재 및 재배포 금지]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=105&oid=092&aid=0002183460
2020.01.01.	노컷뉴스	지난 10년간 우리를 변화시킨 기술들	'스크린 시대' 카톡, 인스타, 4G LTE, 간편결제, 에어팟, 넷플릭스[CBS노컷뉴스 김민수 기자](사진=pixabay 제공)2010년대는 '모바일 시대' '스크린 시대'라고 정의할 수 있다. 전 세계 스마트폰 사용량은 40억대에 달하고 한국의 스마트폰 보급률은 95%로 세계 1위다. 손 안의 스크린을 통해 콘텐츠와 제품을 소비하는 것은 물론 소통의 핵심 창구가 되면서 전 세계가 '모바일 퍼스트'를 외친 시대다. 지난 10년 우리 생활을 변화시킨 기술들이 쏟아졌다.2007년 아이폰이 등장할 때만 해도 다가올 혁명적인 변화를 대부분 예상하지 못했다. 우리가 교과서에서 배운 18세기 이후 산업혁명도 그랬다. 1차·2차·3차 산업혁명이 증기기관, 전기에너지, 컴퓨터·인터넷을 중심으로 인류의 삶을 관통하면서 권력과 자본의 폭발적인 성장과 부를 가져왔다면 인공지능(AI), 사물인터넷(IoT), 로봇기술, 드론, 자율주행차, 가상현실(VR) 등이 주도하는 차세대 4차 산업혁명은 정보기술을 누구나 공유하는 민주화를 표방한다. 과학기술이 우리 삶의 대부분에 영향을 주면서 점차 생활, 환경, 복지, 안전, 윤리적인 문제가 부각되고 편의성과 혁신성 못지 않게 시민의 가치 및 이해와 충돌하는 경우가 잦아지고 있다. 지난 10년은 모바일, 자율주행, 가상·증강현실(AR/VR), 인공지능(AI), 사물인터넷(IoT) 등이 출현하면서 기술이 일방에서 양방향 소통으로 변화하고 있다. 특히 스마트폰을 중심으로 한 기술의 개인화는 이용자의 선택권을 넓히는 계기가 됐다. 스마트폰에서 눈을 떼지 못한 지난 10년간 어떤 기술이 우리의 삶을 변화시켰을까카카오톡 (사진=연합뉴스)1. 카카오톡국산 스마트폰용 무료 통화 및 메신저 앱인 카카오톡은 2010년 3월 출시됐다. 2019년 현재 국내 모바일 메신저 점유율의 95%를 차지하는 '국민 메신저'다. 이전까지만 해도 글로벌 메신저 앱인 왓츠앱이나 스카이프를 사용했지만 스마트폰 점유율이 절대적인 국내에서는 카카오톡을 사용하지 않고는 소통이 불가능할 정도다.신생 벤처기업인 카카오톡의 폭발적인 성장은 국내 2위 포털사 다음을 인수하고 콜택시, 대리운전, 간편결제, 인터넷전문은행까지 진출하는 등 모바일 플랫폼에서 가장 혁신적인 성공가도를 달리고 있다.기업평가사이트 CEO스코어가 31일 공개한 자료에 따르면 김범수 카카오 의장의 지분(14.92%) 가치는 1조9210억원으로 국내 상장사 보유지분 기준 이건희·이재용(삼성), 최태원(SK), 정의선(현대차) 등에 이어 9위를 차지했다.  스티브 잡스가 2010년 아이패드를 선보이고 있다. (사진=애플)2. 아이패드애플이 2010년 4월 첫 출시한 태블릿 컴퓨터다. 스티브 잡스의 유작이기도 한 아이패드는 그가 "믿을 수 없을만큼 훌륭하다. 노트북보다 더 나은 도구이자 스마트 폰보다 더 좋은 도구"라며 "최고의 브라우징 경험을 제공할 것"이라고 자신한 혁신 제품이다.기술적으로는 크게 새로울 것 없는 매우 큰 대형 아이폰이나 아이팟 터치에 가까웠지만 대화면을 통해 사진, 동영상 작업은 물론 세밀한 문서작업을 처리할 수 있다는 점에서 각광을 받았다. 노트북과 스마트폰의 중간단계로 삼성 등 안드로이드 태블릿이 등장하기 전까지 남녀노소 모두에게 엔터테인먼트 소비 및 사용자 콘텐츠 제작 디바이스를 각광을 받았고, 특히 기업의 제조시설, 영업 현장에 적지않은 영향을 끼쳤다. 보안과 안정성, 업무용 앱의 완성도가 높은 iOS에 대한 선호도가 크기 때문이다. 2018년 기준 약 3억6000만대가 팔렸다. 아이패드의 가격은 499달러에서 829달러 사이로 가격의 큰 변화없이 대부분 가격 동결 출시됐다. 2019년에는 10.2인치 아이패드(7세대), 7.9인치 아이패드 미니(5세대)와 동일한 성능에 크기만 10.5인치로 늘린 아이패드 에어(3세대)를 출시했다.  (사진=pixabay)3. 인스타그램2010년 10월 출시된 인스타그램은 출시 첫날에만 2만5000명이 가입할 정도로 핫한 소셜미디어로 등장했다. 페이스북이나 트위터와 달리 사진 등 이미지 위주의 플랫폼으로 스마트폰 카메라 경쟁이 본격화 되고 특히 여성들의 라이프 감성이 겹치면서 인기를 끌었다. 페이스북과 트위터의 장점을 결합한 것이 특징이다.첫 해 12월까지 100만명, 이듬해 가을 1000만명으로 이용자가 폭발적으로 증가하면서 '2011년 올해의 아이폰 앱'에 선정되기도 했다. 해시태그 사진찾기 기능, 다양한 필터 도입으로 트렌드에 민감한 젊은층의 가입이 지속적으로 늘었다. 현재 가입자수는 10억명을 돌파했다. 연예인, 스타들의 전유물이었던 인플루언서 영역이 일반으로 확대되면서 비즈니스 모델이 부재했던 소셜미디어는 광고 등 새로운 영향력을 행사하는 핵심 크리에이터의 산실로 급부상하고 있다.  페이스북을 위협하는 인스타그램의 성장을 눈여겨 본 페이스북은 2012년 4월 10억달러에 인수했다. 예상은 적중해 2018년 기준 기업가치는 1000억달러(약 110조원)에 달한다. 페이스북에 인수된 이후 독립경영을 해왔지만 페이스북의 새로운 전략으로 내부 갈등이 커지면서 공동창업자 2명이 회사를 그만뒀다. 마크 저커버그 페이스북 CEO는 측근인 페이스북 뉴스피드 부문 사장 아담 모세리를 작년 10월부로 인스타그램 신임 대표에 임명했다.  애플 아이폰5 발표 (사진=애플)4. 4G LTE우리가 사진과 동영상을 쉽고 빠르게 공유하는 일상을 시작한 것은 불과 9년도 채 되지 않은 때였다. 2G(CDMA·GSM)와 3G(WCDMA)를 잇는 차세대 이동통신 표준의 4번째 세대다. 이론상 영화 한 편(1.4GB) 다운로드 속도는 3G가 최고(HSPA) 15분, 4G(LTE)가 3분으로 최대 5배 이상 빠르다. 통상 LTE는 3.9G에 속하지만 국내에서는 4G로 본다. 국제 4G 규격은 '4G LTE' 또는 'LTE 어드밴스'로 표시한다. 4G 통신규격은 2011년 4월 국제전기통신연합(ITU) 표준으로 공식 발표됐다. HTC Evo가 미국 시장에서 처음 4G 폰을 출시했고, 삼성이 6월 4G 폰을 출시했다. 하지만 사용자는 출시 1년 이상을 사실상 3.5G 수준의 부족한 속도를 경험해야 했다. 국내에서는 안드로이드 스마트폰과 4G 가입자가 폭발적으로 증가하자 통신사의 데이터 제한이라는 '꼼수'도 이때 등장했다.애플은 이듬해인 2012년 가을 아이폰5를 출시할 때까지 자사 모바일 장치에 4G 통신모뎀을 탑재하지 않았다. 국가별로 서로 다른 통신규격과 4G 규격을 도입하는 국가 분포도 그리 높지 않았기 때문이다. 삼성이 출시한 스마트폰의 경우 당시 출시한 갤럭시S3는 무려 9개 버전으로 출시됐는데 북미 출시 버전은 이동통신사 사정에 따라 5개 버전을 출시해야 할 정도로 혼탁했다.과기부의 '무선 데이터 트래픽 통계'에 따르면 2018년 6월 기준 한국인 1인당 스마트폰 데이터 월 사용량은 7.4GB에 달했다. 4G LTE 도입 1년 뒤인 2012년 12월 월 사용량 1.79GB의 4배에 육박하는 수치다. 이같은 변화는 무제한 데이터 요금제 도입의 영향이 컸다. 무제한 요금제 이용자의 경우는 20GB에 달했다. 데이터 전송 속도와 사용 가능한 용량이 늘어날수록 사용자의 데이터 사용량은 급격히 늘어났다.2019년은 채 10년도 지나지 않아 5G 모바일 네트워크 구축에 열을 올린 뜨거운 해였다. 전문가들은 초당 최대 2.5GB의 데이터를 다운로드할 수 있는 5G의 서비스가 완전히 갖춰지는 시기를 2022년으로 보고 있다.  (이미지=연합뉴스)5. 토스비록 역사는 짧지만 국내 핀테크(fintech) 시장을 개척한 선두자라고 할 수 있다. 핀테크 스타트업 비바버블리카의 토스(toss)는 2015년 2월 공인인증서 없이 쉽고 빠르게 송금할 수 있는 간편 송금 서비스를 선보이며 폭발적인 인기를 누리고 있다.글로벌 전자결제 시스템 페이팔의 영향을 받은 서비스지만 스마트폰 사용 비중이 95%에 달하는 국내에서는 보기 힘든 서비스였다. 금융 서비스는 규제가 특히 심했기 때문이다.토스는 소액결제 규제가 느슨한 점을 파고들었다. 점심시간 더치페이가 일상이 된 직장인과 지인의 경조사에 소액을 송금하려는 이들에게 은행 문턱은 높았다. 스마트폰이나 PC에 공인인증서 등 각종 보안매체를 설치해야 하고 은행이나 ATM을 찾아 송금 수수료까지 내야했다. 반면 토스는 시중은행과의 제휴를 통해 공인인증서나 보안카드, OTP 없이도 빠른 송금이 가능했다. 2019년 12월 현재 누적 가입자 1600만명, 누적 송금액 69조원을 돌파하며 국내 핀테크 시장의 유니콘 기업으로 성장했다. 토스는 간편송금 서비스를 시작으로 계좌, 카드, 신용등급, 보험 등 금융 조회 서비스, 계좌 개설·적금·대출 상품 가입과 같은 뱅킹 서비스, P2P·펀드·해외 주식 등 금융투자 서비스까지 선보인데다 케이뱅크, 카카오뱅크에 이어 제3 인터넷전문은행으로 도약할 준비를 하고 있다. (이미지=아마존/pexels)6. 아마존 에코2014년 하반기 아마존이 출시한 스마트 피커 에코(echo)는 아이폰에 들어있던 시리(Siri)를 처음 스마트폰 밖으로 끄집어낸 인공지능(AI) 음성비서 서비스였다. 23.5㎝ 높이의 원기둥 모양의 스피커에 빔포밍 기술을 적용해 음성으로 통제하는 가상 비서 알렉사를 불러내 음성 상호작용, 음악 재생, 할 일 목록 만들기, 알람 설정, 스트리밍 팟캐스트, 오디오북 재생, 날씨, 기타 실시간 정보 제공을 통해 사용자 맞춤 서비스로 주목을 받았다. 2010년부터 에코를 개발한 것으로 알려졌다. 세계 최대 전자상거래 업체 아마존이 2007년 전자책 단말기 킨들을 세상에 내놓은 후 두 번째 작품이다. 클라우드와 인공지능(AI) 시대가 열리면서 아마존 에코는 북미와 유럽시장에서 가장 많이 팔리는 스마트 스피커로 부상했다. 하지만 구글의 구글 어시스턴트가 설치된 구글홈의 맹추격에 비해 언어지원이 적어 글로벌 판매 비중은 적은 편이다. 스마트 홈 허브 역할을 하면서 자신이 직접 여러 스마트 장치를 통제할 수 있어 사물인터넷(IoT) 시장을 견인하고 있다 해도 과언이 아니다. 국내에서는 SK 누구를 시작으로 KT 기가지니, 카카오, 네이버 등이 잇달아 스마트 스피커 시장에 진출했지만 대부분 음악 듣기에 그쳐 스마트 허브로의 이동은 더딘 상황이다. 국내 보급률은 초기 마케팅에 힘입어 2018년 100만대를 넘어선 이후 답보상태에 있다. 5G 및 IoT 기술 제품의 보편화 이후 추동을 발휘할 것으로 기대된다.(이미지=애플)7. 에어팟2016년 아이폰7과 함께 등장한 에어팟은 '콩나물' '칫솔 브러쉬'와 같은 혹평을 받았지만 완전 무선이어폰 시장에 돌풍을 일으키며 에어팟 신드롬을 일으켰다. 3년이 지난 지금 길에서 만나는 무선 이어폰 사용자 열에 예닐곱은 에어팟 착용자라 할 정도로 흔해졌다.  시장분석 업체 카운터포인트 리서치에 따르면 2018년 글로벌 무선 이어폰 판매량은 4600만대로 이중 에어팟이 3500만대를 차지한 것으로 나타났다. 업계 전문가들은 지난 3월 출시한 무선충전 에어팟 2세대에 힘입어 애플이 올해 6000만대 이상의 에어팟을 판매할 것으로 전망하고 있다. 2019년 가을 출시된 노이즈 캔슬링(ANC)이 탑재된 에어팟 프로는 구하기 힘들정도로 품귀현상까지 빚고 있다.시장 전문가들은 에어팟 판매량이 2019년 전년대비 2배 증가한 60억달러(약 6조9300억원)에 달하며 2020년에는 150억달러(약 17조3250억원)에 달할 것으로 전망하고 있다. (이미지=넷플릭스/pexels)8. 넷플릭스하드 드라이브나 DVD에 음악과 영화를 저장했던 때가 있었다. DVD 온라인 대여 배송 서비스로 출발한 넷플릭스는 2007년 미국에서 처음 온라인동영상서비스(OTT)를 시작해 2010년 9월 처음으로 캐나다에 해외 진출했다. 2011년 남미, 2012년 영국, 덴마크, 노르웨이 등 유럽대륙에 진출했다. 대부분 영어사용이 가능한 국가에 집중됐지만 2015년 일본이 아시아 국가 중 처음, 두 번째로 2016년 한국을 서비스 국가로 확대하면서 이 시기 스트리밍 시장이 폭발적으로 성장하기 시작했다. 현재 서비스 국가는 190개에 달한다. 전세계 오피스에 근무하는 종업원은 5400명에 달하고 2018년 기준 매출은 157억달러(약 18조원)에 달한다. TV·영화 콘텐츠 시장에 일으킨 넷플릭스 붐은 음악 스트리밍의 강자 스포티파이와 애플뮤직, 동영상 스트리밍의 유아독존 유튜브, 게임 스트리밍의 견인차 트위치의 등장과 성장으로 이어졌다.다만 지난 10년간 스트리밍 시장을 견인해온 넷플릭스도 2020년 이후엔 강력한 경쟁자를 맞이해야 한다. 월트 디즈니 스튜디오와 월트 디즈니 텔레비전, 픽사, 마블, 스타워즈, 내셔널 지오그래픽, 20세기 폭스 등을 거느린 막강한 디즈니 군단이 스트리밍 서비스 '디즈니+'라는 거함을 출항시켰기 때문이다. 영국 역사학자 아놀드 토인비는 산업혁명을 "기술혁신과 그에 수반해 일어난 사회 및 경제구조의 변혁"이라 정의하면서도 "이는 격변적이고 격렬한 현상이 아니라 그 이전부터 시작하여 온 점진적이고 연속적인 기술혁신의 과정"이라고 평가했다. 지난 10년간 기술의 진화와 새로운 서비스는 '가랑비에 옷 젖는 줄 모른다'는 조상들의 말처럼 순식간에 우리 일상에 젖어들어 왔다. ▶ 확 달라진 노컷뉴스▶ 인싸들의 선택, 노컷뉴스 구독 서비스▶ 노컷이 못한 일, 돈컷은 한다maxpress@cbs.co.kr저작권자 © CBS 노컷뉴스 무단전재 및 재배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=079&aid=0003307160

2020.05.24.	edaily	'결제' 이어 ‘인증’과 ‘신용평가’까지..테크기업, 금융시장 대공습	- 네이버 인증, SKT 신용평가, 쿠팡 결제 시장 도전- 학계,정보(데이터) 쥔 IT기업들 승리 예상- 사회적 대책은 규제완화냐·투명성 제고냐 의견 갈려[이데일리 김현아 기자]데이터 기술로 무장한 테크(Tech·기술)기업의 금융시장 공습이 시작됐다. 전자서명·금융 규제가 완화되고 개인임을 알 수 없는 가명정보가 동의 없이 사용할 수 있게 돼 비금융 데이터의 활용 범위가 넓어진 이유에서다. 데이터를 손에 쥔 기업이 더 편리하고 혜택이 큰 서비스를 제공할 수 있게 됐으나, 자칫 데이터 독점기업의 금융시장 독점으로 인한 부작용을 우려하는 목소리도 나온다.24일 업계에 따르면 네이버와 SK텔레콤, 쿠팡 등이 금융과 IT 융합시장(Fintech·핀테크)에 속속 진입하면서 인터넷은행 면허를 가진 카카오·KT·비바리퍼블리카(토스) 등과 경쟁을 선언했다. ▲공인인증서 대체하는 네이버 인증서 쓰임네이버 인증, SKT 신용평가, 쿠팡 결제 시장 도전네이버는 네이버파이낸셜 분사를 계기로 미래에셋대우와 CMA(자산관리계좌) ‘네이버통장’을 이달 중 선보이는데 이어 ‘네이버인증서’를 국민연금공단, 메리츠화재 등의 고지서 수령까지 확대하면서 네이버페이와 연계할 계획이다. 네이버인증서는 네이버 아이디로 로그인하면 간편하게 본인 인증이 가능하다. 모바일 전자고지는 네이버뿐 아니라 카카오·이통3사도 뛰어들었지만 업계는 최대 플랫폼 기업인 네이버의 위력을 두려워한다.SK텔레콤과 쿠팡의 핀테크 시장 진입도 시작됐다. SK텔레콤은 비금융정보전문 신용조회업 허가에 관한 규제 특례로 신용평가업에 진출했다. 비금융 데이터를 활용해 기존 금융정보 기반의 신용평가 방법을 보완한 ‘셀러 스코어’를 개발해 현대캐피탈과 11번가에서 물건을 파는 중소기업을 대상으로 대출 상품을 추천해주는 서비스를 시작했다. 이는 통신료, 공공요금 납부 정보 등에 기반한 신용 평가 서비스를 하는 미국 FICO와 비슷한 사업모델이다. FICO는 최근 3년간 매출이 연평균 약 10% 늘고 시가총액도 2.8배 상승했다. 쿠팡 역시 최근 쿠팡페이 분사를 계기로 현재 1천만 명이 쓰는 간편결제 쿠페이를 기반으로 하는 종합핀테크플랫폼으로의 도약을 꿈꾸고 있다.▲SK텔레콤은 11번가, 현대캐피탈과협력해 이달 비금융 데이터 기반 신용 평가를 활용한 11번가 중소 셀러 대상 대출 상품 ‘11번가 이커머스 팩토링’을 출시했다.학계, 규제완화냐·투명성 제고냐 의견 갈려업계와 학계는 IT대기업들의 핀테크 시장 진입에 대해 긍정적으로 평가하면서도 우려 의견을 내놓고 있다. 업계 관계자는 “AI시대에는 가명처리 등 데이터 활용 조항들을 보다 탄력적으로 해석할 필요가 있다”면서 “기업에 사전 규제는 완화하되 사후적인 민사·행정 책임을 강화할 필요가 있다”고 말했다. 데이터 활용을 위해 정부의 전향적인 규제완화가 필요하다는 입장이다. 반면 장석권 한양대 경영학부 교수는 “정보를 가진 IT기업들이 힘을 갖는 미국처럼 국내금융 시장도 마찬가지로 재편될 것”이라면서 “테크 기업들의 진입으로 소비자 효용은 커지나 데이터 결합이나 절차에서 투명성을 지켜야 부작용을 막을 수 있다”고 말했다.김현아 (chaos@edaily.co.kr)네이버에서 ‘이데일리’ 구독하기▶청춘뉘우스~ 스냅타임▶＜ⓒ종합 경제정보 미디어 이데일리 - 무단전재 & 재배포 금지＞	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=105&oid=018&aid=0004647394
2020.05.29.	세계닷컴	하렉스인포텍, 엔디에스(NDS)와 메디칼 핀테크 협약	사용자 중심의 결제 공유플랫폼 ‘유비페이’ 서비스를 제공하는 하렉스인포텍은 NDS(대표 김중원)와 함께 병원 예약부터 실손보험 청구, 진료비 및 약제비 결제 등을 이용자가 모바일로 비대면 처리할 수 있는 스마트 호스피탈(Smart Hospital) 구축을 위한 업무 협약을 맺었다고 28일 밝혔다.     27일 서울 동작구 NDS 본사에서 박경양 하렉스인포텍 대표(오른쪽)와 김중원 NDS 대표가 업무협약을 맺은 뒤 기념 촬영을 하고 있다.     하렉스인포텍은 병원과 약국 이용자들이 진료비 및 입원비 결제, 전자처방전 전달 및 약제비 결제 등을 스마트폰에서 처리할 수 있는 메디칼 핀테크(Medical FinTech) 서비스를 제공하고 있다. NDS는 외래진료(예약?접수?대기?수납?처방?보험청구?입퇴원)와 건강검진, 건강수첩 서비스를 담은 스마트 호스피탈(Smart Hospital) 모바일 플랫폼을 보급 중이다.   양사는 이번 협약에서 각 사가 보유한 솔루션을 상호 결합, 진료예약부터 실손보험 접수까지 병원에서 이뤄지는 모든 서비스를 모바일 플랫폼에 하나로 연결해 병원 앱은 물론 일반 앱에서도 간편하게 이용할 수 있도록 서비스의 범용성을 확대하고 영업도 공동으로 추진하기로 했다.    현재 보급 중인 병원 서비스는 모두 병원 앱을 기반으로 제공되고 있으나 병원 앱의 특성상 앱 보급이 용이하지 않아 서비스 활성화가 미흡한 상태다. 또 제공하는 서비스의 범위도 업체별로 분산돼 있어 이용자의 편의성이 떨어지고 서비스를 도입한 병원도 대기고객 감축이나 비용절감 등의 기대 효과를 얻지 못해 만족도가 낮다.   하렉스인포텍은 모바일 지불결제 원조기업으로 수십 개의 간편결제 서비스 중 유일하게 중간사업자가 없는 사용자 중심의 지불결제 서비스인 유비페이 플랫폼을 다른 앱에 무상 공유, 제휴사 자체 브랜드로 맞춤형 간편결제 서비스를 제공하도록 지원하고 있다. NDS는 내부 IT 역량과 건강보험심사평가원 등 보건의료기관 프로젝트 수행에서 쌓은 노하우를 기반으로 ‘헬스케어 IT에 특화된 기업’으로 전환하는 중이어서 이번 양사의 협약이 높은 시너지를 거둘 것으로 회사는 기대하고 있다.   조현일 기자 conan@segye.comⓒ 세상을 보는 눈, 세계일보	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=022&aid=0003469752

The latest security chip is Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level 6+ certified, the highest level acquired by a mobile component. The CC EAL 6+ is granted for applications that demand the most stringent security requirements such as flagship smartphones, e-passports and hardware wallets for cryptocurrency.In addition to the hacking prevention program, the new security solution supports hardware-based root of trust, secure boot and device authentication with twice the secure storage capacity. “In this era of mobility and contact-less interactions, we expect our connected devices, such as smartphones or tablets, to be highly secure so as to protect personal data and enable fintech activities such as mobile banking, stock trading and cryptocurrency transactions,” said Shin Dong-ho, senior vice president of System LSI marketing at Samsung.Samsung plans to roll out the solution in the third quarter of this year. By Song Su-hyun (song@heraldcorp.com)[네이버에서 코리아헤럴드 구독]▶ KH Podcast     ▶ KH Video<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000218519
2020.02.05.	연합뉴스	[PRNewswire] East Ventures Digital Competitiveness Index 2020: Uncovering The	Opportunities of Indonesia's Digital Economy and Bridging the Archipelago Digital Divide(JAKARTA, Indonesia, Feb. 4, 2020 PRNewswire=연합뉴스) East Ventures, the pioneer of Indonesia's early-stage venture capital scene, released East Ventures - Digital Competitiveness Index (EV-DCI) 2020, a comprehensive report of digital economy development in 34 provinces and 24 big cities across Indonesia.East Ventures Digital Competitiveness Index 2020The report outlined a picture of a digital divide in Indonesia, one of the fastest-growing digital economies in the world. The disparities between the rapidly developed digital ecosystem in Indonesia's urban area and the regions beyond it shows that Indonesia's digital journey has just begun.East Ventures Digital Competitiveness Index (EV-DCI), a measurement that factors in 9 aspects relating to digital development, shows that the majority of Indonesian is ready to adopt digital services due to high smartphone ownership and internet access. Yet, EV-DCI's score for human resources and entrepreneurship is still low. Meaning, only a small number of Indonesians are utilizing technology to open businesses or improve productivity.The digital divide also shows that the fast-growing internet-based companies that operate in the Indonesian market (six of those are unicorns), serves only a fraction of Indonesia's economy. By scaling up and extending their services across the archipelago, those companies have an immense opportunity to grow their business exponentially.Some key highlights of the report:Centralizes on JavaThe provinces on the island of Java records the highest EV-DCI score in comparison to all other provinces. This evidently shows the gap between Java and other Indonesian regions. Furthermore, the EV-DCI score for cities highlights a developmental inequality seen by the huge gap between the city that ranked first, Jakarta, and the city that ranked second, Bandung.Financial DisruptionThe financial industry is one of the most affected by digitalization in Indonesia. In areas with a high EV-DCI score, banks close their branch offices at a faster rate. EV-DCI score is also correlated with a high disbursement of credit by fintech lenders and the number of branchless banking financial agents.Talent Pool ShortageThe growth of the digital economy creates a more competitive talent market which produces a pool of skilled workforce. Though areas with high digital competitiveness tend to absorb more of these professionals and skilled workers.Several jobs such as administrative work, machine operators, and laborers are expected to be impacted the most by digitalization. Evidently, the number of these workers in the ICT, finance, and transportation industries has been facing the sharpest decline.New BaliDigital competitiveness in areas prepared to be the 'New Bali' such as Labuan Bajo, Lake Toba, Raja Ampat, Borobudur Temple, Mount Bromo, and Morotai must be improved in providing access to information, comfort, and attractiveness for foreign tourists.Willson Cuaca, Co-founder and Managing Partner of East Ventures explained, "The digital economy promises inclusivity and equal economic opportunities for all Indonesians. However, Indonesia is often times only assessed from the development of certain big cities like Jakarta, while there are still many cities untouched by the promise of the digital economy. By allowing everyone to participate in the digital economy, Indonesia could convert demographic bonuses into demographic dividends; turning potential into reality."The full report can be downloaded at east.vc/DCIAbout East Ventures    East Ventures is the first early-stage investor in Indonesia and stands amongst the most consistently top-performing venture capitals globally with a constantly high IRR. Established since 2009, the firm has supported more than 170 digitally-enabled companies in Southeast Asia, with 130 companies founded in and operating in Indonesia.East Ventures has worked alongside entrepreneurs to build Indonesia's digital ecosystem from the ground up since day 1. Spotting opportunities early, the firm is the first venture capital to support Indonesia's two homegrown unicorns: Tokopedia and Traveloka. The firm has since then invested in other industry themes, including supporting infrastructure to e-commerce such as Waresix (logistics), Xendit (payment), Kudo (offline to online), Shopback (e-commerce enabler), vertical commerce such as Sociolla (new retail beauty), media such as IDN Media (millennial and gen-z audience), Tech in Asia (tech audience), and Katadata (business and economy audience), SME support such as Mekari (accounting, tax, payroll), Moka (POS), CoHive (coworking), new retail such as Warung Pintar (FMCG) and Fore Coffee (on-demand coffee chains), and digital transformation such as Advotics (supply chain analytics) and Nodeflux (computer vision and AI).Over the past decade, the firm has grown its Southeast Asian assets reaching US$1.2 bn under management for both the early-stage and growth funds. The firm has delivered more than 20 exits, including Kudo's acquisition by Grab, Loket's acquisition by Gojek, Bridestory's acquisition by Tokopedia, and multiple exits to both local and regional business groups. It has also attracted a total of US$4 bn in follow-on funding that fostered the growth of Indonesia's digital economy today.Photo - https://photos.prnasia.com/prnh/20200204/2710733-1Source: East Ventures[편집자 주] 본고는 자료 제공사에서 제공한 것으로, 연합뉴스는 내용에 대해 어떠한 편집도 하지 않았음을 밝혀 드립니다.▶확 달라진 연합뉴스 웹을 만나보세요▶네이버 [연합뉴스] 채널 구독   ▶뭐 하고 놀까? #흥	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=001&aid=0011378745

2020.05.19.	MoneyToday	포스트 코로나 시대, 핀테크가 허무는 금융 불편	[머니투데이 조철희 기자, 김상희 기자] [[2020 키플랫폼-키맨 인터뷰]] 루시 리우 에어월렉스 공동창업자 겸 대표 / 사진제공=에어월렉스비대면(Contactless) 경제활동은 코로나(COVID-19) 대유행 이전부터 디지털 기술의 힘을 빌려 우리 삶 깊숙이 들어와 있었다. 이미 온라인 쇼핑이 일상화 됐고 새벽배송 등 편의성이 강화된 서비스들까지 등장했고 극장이나 패스트푸드 매장, 기차역 등에서 키오스크로 주문·발권하는 일도 흔했다. 대면이 필요한 오프라인 경제활동은 줄어들었다. 금융 분야에선 기술(technology)과 융합한 핀테크(fintech)가 비대면 서비스로 성장하던 중 코로나 유행 이후 더욱 주목받고 있다. 과거에는 예금, 대출, 보험 가입, 신용카드 발급 등을 금융기관 영업점을 방문해야 할 수 있었지만 지금은 대부분의 금융 업무를 모바일 애플리케이션서 터치 몇 번으로 할 수 있다.코로나 대유행에 따른 팬더모니엄 이후(포스트 팬더모니엄) 새롭게 펼쳐질 미래상과 한국 기업들의 대응 전략을 제시할 머니투데이미디어 글로벌 컨퍼런스 '2020 키플랫폼'(K.E.Y PLATFORM 2020)이 글로벌 핀테크 유니콘(10억 달러 이상 가치 비상장 스타트업) 기업들과 인터뷰해 이 분야의 성장 포인트를 짚어봤다. 지난해 창업 3년여 만에 유니콘이 된 호주 스타트업 에어월렉스(Airwallex)는 은행들을 통한 해외 송금 시 높은 수수료로 인한 이용자 부담을 창의적인 아이디어로 크게 낮춰 주목받으며 성장하고 있는 핀테크 플랫폼이다.예컨대 한국의 A기업이 미국의 B기업에 100만 달러를 송금하려 하고, 미국의 C기업이 A기업의 100만 달러를 필요로 할 때 에어월렉스는 A와 C를 연결하는 방법으로 송금·환전 수수료를 최소화하는 서비스를 제공한다. 어느 사업가가 해외에서 번 돈을 국내로 들여올 때도 에어월렉스를 통하면 시간과 비용을 절약할 수 있다. 에어월렉스는 B2B(기업간 거래) 중심이며 대기업보다도 중소기업들의 이용에 초점을 맞추고 있다. 이 회사 창업자들은 호주에서 직장을 다니다 부업으로 커피숍을 열려고 했다. 준비 중 해외에서 커피잔을 수입하려고 했는데 송금과 환전에 큰 은행 수수료가 드는 것에 놀랐다. 이들은 이같은 어려움을 겪는 중소기업이나 소상공인들을 위해 서비스 개발에 나섰다.다음은 에어월렉스 루시 리우 공동창업자 겸 대표(사진)와의 인터뷰 일문일답.-에어월렉스가 개선하고자 하는 문제는 무엇인가.▶에어월렉스를 탄생시킨 아이디어는 공동창업자 잭 장과 맥스 리가 호주 멜버른에서 카페를 열었을 때 겪은 문제에서 나왔다. 중국과 동남아시아에서 커피잔을 수입 중이었고 국제 거래를 위해 국가간 결제 서비스 업체를 이용해야 했는데 이런 서비스 이용 경험이 전반적으로 불만족스럽다고 느꼈다. 속도가 느리고 비용은 비쌌으며 투명성도 부족했다. 그보다 더 중요한 것은 제대로 된 기술에 기반을 둔 국가간 결제방식이 전무했다는 것이었다. 외환 분야 개발자였던 잭은 이 문제를 해결할 수 있는 더 좋은 방법이 있음을 알고 있었다. 에어월렉스는 이런 고충에 대응하기 위해 2015년 12월에 설립됐다. 우리는 고속도·저비용의 국가간 결제 서비스를 제공하는 것을 목표로 출발했고 이는 여전히 우리 사업의 핵심이다. -핀테크 기업으로서 AI(인공지능) 기술은 어떻게 활용하고 있는가.▶AI와 머신러닝(machine learning·기계학습)등 독창적인 최첨단 기술들을 도입했다. 법규정 준수 관련 지식 맵을 만들어 자금세탁이나 테러자금 차단 등에 관련된 실시간 거래 검사·감시를 지원한다. AI와 빅데이터를 강력한 지능형 FX(외환거래) 엔진에 내장해 가격경쟁력, FX 상품의 다양화, 복수통화 변환 등을 제공하고 있다.-비즈니스의 확장은 어떻게 모색하고 있는가.▶우리는 고객의 변화하는 요구사항을 충족시키기 위해 끊임없이 포트폴리오를 향상시키고 있다. 최근에는 비자와 파트너십을 맺어 가상 카드를 출시했고 최고의 회계 소프트웨어 회사인 제로와 통합 프로그램도 선보였다.-성장과정에서 어떤 협업을 이루고 있는가.▶우리는 생태계의 힘을 믿고 있다. 다른 기업들이 우리 인프라를 기반으로 자체적인 시스템을 구축할 수 있도록 오픈 API(애플리케이션 프로그래밍 인터페이스)를 개발했다. 중국 전자상거래 업체 징동닷컴도 이를 이용하고 있다.이해관계자들과 긍정적인 관계를 구축하는 것이 얼마나 중요한지 잘 알고 있다. 특히 정부, 규제기관과의 관계는 우리가 법규정을 잘 준수하기 위해서도 필요하다. 우리는 빠르게 성장해왔고 기업으로서 많은 진전이 있었지만 멜버른에서 작은 스타트업으로 설립된 우리의 근원을 잊지 않고 있다. 멘토링 워크숍 지원 프로그램 등을 통해 스타트업 공동체에 가능한 많은 것을 돌려주기 위한 노력도 기울이고 있다.-한국시장 진출 계획은 있는가.▶창업 이래 확장의 경로를 걸어왔다. 현재 전세계 10개국에서 400여 명이 일하고 있다. 아시아 지역이 6개국인데 한국도 가까운 시일 안에 진출을 기대한다. 허가 준비나 현지 기업들과의 파트너십 등이 필요할 것으로 보인다.조철희 기자 samsara@mt.co.kr, 김상희 기자 ksh15@mt.co.kr▶줄리아 투자노트▶조 변호사의 가정상담소 ▶머니투데이 구독하기 <저작권자 ⓒ '돈이 보이는 리얼타임 뉴스' 머니투데이, 무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=008&aid=0004410953
2020.06.08.	매경닷컴	수앤파이낸셜인베, 쌍용정보통신 인수 마무리…국내외 잇따른 ICT 기업 투자	쌍용정보통신은 수피아이티센홀딩스(운용사 수앤파이낸셜인베스트먼트)가 쌍용정보통신의 경영권 인수를 위한 잔금 지급을 완료해 본 투자를 원활히 마무리했다고 밝혔다. 이에 따라 수피아이티센홀딩스가 쌍용정보통신의 최대주주로 올라선다. 8일 관련 업계에 따르면 쌍용정보통신은 1981년 설립된 국내 1호 IT서비스 기업으로 국방·스포츠·네트워크 통합 분야에서 강점을 나타내왔다. 지난 2월 수앤파이낸셜인베스트먼트(이하 수피)는 아이티센그룹과의 컨소시엄을 통해 한앤컴퍼니가 소유하고 있던 쌍용정보통신의 40% 지분을 274억원(주당 1695원)에 인수하는 주식양수도계약을 체결한 바 있다.◆코로나19 팬데믹으로 인한 시장 위기에도 인수 완료한앤컴퍼니는 2016년 쌍용양회 인수 이후 시멘트 사업 위주로 재편하면서 쌍용정보통신은 이미 수 년전부터 잠재 매물로 거론돼 왔다. 하지만 마땅한 인수자를 찾지 못하고 있는 상황이었다. 그런면에서 이번 딜은 수피 입장에서는 모회사의 인수합병(M&A) 자문사 DNA를 십분 발휘한 투자사(신기사, PE)로서의 능력을 입증할 수 있는 기회였다.그러나 주식매매계약(SPA) 체결 직후 터진 코로나19 팬데믹 상황으로 인해 국내 증시는 계속된 하락세를 맞았고 여러 상장사 인수 딜이 무산되는 상황이 나옴에 따라 이번 딜의 종결에 우려를 나타내는 시장 분위기도 있었다. 그럼에도 수피는 지난 4월 17일 SPA 정정 공시를 내면서 분위기를 바꿔 나갔고 잔금을 마무리하면서 투자사로서의 역량을 재확인했다.◆잇따른 국내외 ICT기업 투자 통해 포트폴리오 구성의 선구안·투자 능력 입증수피는 국내 최초의 IT 서비스 기업 인수를 통해 그간 구축해온 ICT 기업에 대한 투자 포트폴리오를 바탕으로 기업간 시너지를 증대할 예정이다. 뿐만 아니라 코로나19로 인한 비대면 산업의 성장과 한국판 뉴딜 정책에 맞춘 투자를 진행해 사업간 시너지를 높이고, 시장의 흐름에 발맞춰 포트폴리오를 더욱 강화하겠다는 입장이다.이미 수피는 작년 홍콩 소재의 핀테크 기업인 TNG Fintech Group(TNG)에 크로스보더 투자를 시작했으며, 같은 해에 소프트센의 경영권 지분을 인수했다. 이어 콤텍정보통신과 소프트아이텍의 지분 인수를 후속적으로 완료해 국내외 ICT기업의 시너지 창출을 통한 투자자산 가치 극대화에 노력하고 있다.실제 TNG에 대한 투자한 당시 같은 해에 수피는 수피센투자조합을 통해 소프트센 지분 25%를 250억원에 인수했다. 당시 수앤파이낸셜인베스트먼트의 김철중 대표는 "매도자인 아이티센도 컨소시엄에 출자자로 재참여하면서 기존사업과 신규사업 간의 시너지를 높일 수 있는 전략을 구사하고 있으며, 전략적 출자자인 홍콩성대인터네셔널과의 중화권 사업역량을 통합해 소프트센의 해외진출을 계획 중"이라고 밝혔다.최근 코로나19의 여파로 정부의 비대면 산업 육성 정책에 따라 소프트센의 주가는 대폭 상승하는 효과를 보기도 했다. 소프트센은 의료정보 빅데이터 및 인공지능 솔루션인 '빅센메드'를 공급하고 있으며, 2016년에 원주의료기기 테크노밸리와의 업무협약을 통한 원격의료 사업도 진행하고 있다. 수피는 소프트센의 의료 부분 사업이 국내를 중심으로 확대되면 중국 등 글로벌 네트워크를 통한 의료서비스 수출 등의 파트너십도 고려 중이다.볼트온(유사 기업 인수합병) 투자로써 지난 4월 소프트센은 텐센트의 전략적 파트너사인 텐클라우드의 지분 60%를 약 145억원에 인수하며, 빅데이터 및 인공지능 교육·의료 사업의 해외시장 진출과 소프트센 신규사업 기반 확보에 박차를 가했다.김철중 대표는 "소프트센 인수에 이어 이번 쌍용정보통신 인수는 아이티센과의 전략적 파트너십을 맺음과 동시에 ICT 분야를 중심으로 국내외 투자를 집중적으로 진행, 인수회사 간의 시너지를 극대화하는 것이 주된 전략"이라고 설명했다.한편 수앤파이낸셜인베스트먼트는 김철중 대표가 지난 2016년 설립 후 2017년에 신기술사업금융회사 및 사모펀드(PEF) 운용사로 등록해 전문적이고 신속한 투자를 진행하고 있다. 수피는 2017년 위니아딤채의 2대주주 지분투자를 시작으로 사모펀드로서 영향력을 드러냈으며 소프트센과 쌍용정보통신, TNG 투자 이외에도 설립 이후 슈마커, 소프트아이텍, 압타머사이언스, 매직마이크로 등에 투자를 진행했다.[김경택 기자 kissmaycry@mkinternet.com]▶네이버 메인에서 '매일경제'를 받아보세요▶매부리TV 구독하고 에어팟프로 득템!! ▶뉴스레터 '매콤달콤' 구독[ⓒ 매일경제 & mk.co.kr, 무단전재 및 재배포 금지]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=009&aid=0004590739
2020.05.11.	코리아헤럴드	Biz group calls on lawmakers to promptly pass economic bills	(Yonhap)South Korean entrepreneurs have called on lawmakers to promptly pass nine economy-related bills as the term of the current National Assembly ends this month. The Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the largest business lobby group here, said Monday that it delivered a report on economic legislation to the National Assembly, including the floor leaders of the main political parties and relevant standing committees. The report called for the passage of nine bills urgently needed to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, the KCCI said. The bills deal with the “Korean New Deal,” as well as measures to revitalize investment and support the hardest-hit business sectors. All pending bills before the 20th National Assembly will be automatically scrapped at the end of its term, which is May 29. The Korean New Deal focuses on building digital infrastructure and fostering non-face-to-face industries.“The digital economy needs fast and convenient authentication and transactions. But in Korea, public certificates have a privileged status and prevent new businesses such as new authentication technologies and electronic signatures,” said the KCCI. The association called for the abolition of public certificates and the revision of the Electronic Signature Act to allow for the use of various electronic signatures.The chamber of commerce also called for changes to the law governing medical practice, which would allow telemedicine and set regulations for it. The KCCI said the COVID-19 situation in Western countries and Japan had proven how efficient and convenient it was to provide access to medical care and prescriptions over the phone. Bold tax support is needed for companies investing in facilities and research and development to overcome the COVID-19 crisis and revive investor sentiment, the KCCI said. It asked for changes to the Restriction of Special Taxation Act, which would grant companies tax deductions equivalent to 10 percent of their investments for three years (2020 to 2022). R&D tax deduction rates have almost halved over the past decade, becoming the lowest among major economies, the KCCI said. The organization voiced the need to amend the Insurance Business Act to lower the minimum capital requirement for the insurance industry from 30 billion won ($24.6 million) to 300 million won. “Compared to major economies, Korea has excessive capital requirements for the financial industry, which act as an entry barrier for new industries such as fintech.” Kim Hyun-soo, a chief of the KCCI’s business policy team, said, “If the pending bills are scrapped due to the expiration of their term, it will make it difficult to promise when the pending issues related to the economy and people’s livelihoods will be resolved.“As the 20th National Assembly is nearing its end, we hope that the important bills will be dealt with in May with a sense of mission.”By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com)[네이버에서 코리아헤럴드 구독]▶ KH Podcast     ▶ KH Video<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000218047

2020.01.18.	아시아경제신문	지원예산·프로그램 모두 '스케일업'…금융당국, 핀테크 육성 박차	참고이미지(출처=한국핀테크산업협회)[아시아경제 김효진 기자] 금융당국이 핀테크(금융기술) 산업 육성을 위한 행보에 속도를 내고 있다. 올해 핀테크 지원 예산이 지난해의 2배로 늘어난 가운데 오는 5월에는 대규모 핀테크 박람회가 개최된다.18일 금융당국에 따르면 금융위원회는 지난해의 약 2배인 198억6000만원의 올해 핀테크 지원예산을 최근 최종 편성했다.금융테스트베드 운영ㆍ참여 지원(96억5700만원)과 맞춤형 성장지원프로그램(16억5500만원), 국민참여 핀테크 행사(17억4300만원) 부문의 예산이 크게 증가했다.아울러 핀테크 해외 진출(8억3000만원), 일자리 매칭(2억원), 금융클라우드 이용(34억4000만원), 핀테크 전문인력 양성(14억4000만원)을 지원하기 위한 예산이 새로 편성됐다.핀테크 육성을 위한 경제활성화를 위해 '상반기 62%, 1분기 37%' 집행을 목표로 각종 사업 추진에 속도를 낸다는 게 금융위의 방침이다.금융위는 이 같은 구상 속에 오는 5월 28~30일 서울 동대문디자인플라자(DDP)에서 국제 핀테크 박람회인 '코리아 핀테크 위크(Korea Fintech Week) 2020'을 개최한다. 금융위는 지난 15일 박람회 준비 태스크포스(TF)를 발족하고 첫 회의를 했다.지난해에 이어 두 번째로 열리는 이번 박람회의 주제는  '핀테크를 통한 개방형 혁신'이다. 올해는 행사공간이 더 넓어져 100개 넘는 개별 전시공간이 마련된다. 지난해(54개 부스)의 약 두 배다.올해 행사에서는 핀테크 스케일업(확장) 추진 전략과 연계해 해외 진출과 투자를 위한 특별 세션, 부대ㆍ상설행사가 진행된다. 일반 국민을 대상으로 한 체험ㆍ교육 시간도 마련된다. 또 혁신적 아이디어를 발굴하기 위해 새로운 핀테크 사업 모델 설명회도 열린다.금융위는 지난 16일 금융감독원ㆍ한국핀테크지원센터와 함께 서울 마포구 서울창업허브에서 '2020년 핀테크 정책설명회'를 열었다. 금융당국은 대폭 늘어난 지원 예산과 각종 지원행사 등에 힘입어 산업 발전에 더욱 매진해줄 것을 핀테크 업계에 당부했다.금융위원회 제공김효진 기자 hjn2529@asiae.co.kr▶ 2020년 경자년(庚子年), 나의 신년운세와 토정비결은?▶ 네이버에서 아시아경제 뉴스를 확인하세요. ▶ 놀 준비 되었다면 드루와! 드링킷!<ⓒ경제를 보는 눈, 세계를 보는 창 아시아경제 무단전재 배포금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=277&aid=0004608123

2020.04.27.	이코노미스트	[속도 붙는 핀테크] ‘돈’의 정체성을 바꾼다	소외계층 없애고, 비용·시간에 혁신… 탐욕 제어하고 시스템 지켜야어떤 이는 ‘핀테크’(FinTech)라 부르고, 어떤 이는 ‘테크핀’(TechFin)이라 부른다. 이 차이는 금융(Finance)과 기술(technology)의 융합에 있어 어느 쪽을 우선해야 하는가 시각차에서 비롯됐다. 일견 주도권 경쟁으로 비치기도 한다. 범용어로는 핀테크라 쓰인다. 당장 사용자 편의를 높이는 합리적 기술 선택보다는 경제시스템을 안전·안정시킬 수 있는 선진적 기술에 무게를 실은 것이다. 금융은 좁게는 자금을 빌려주는 행위를 이르지만, 넓게는 모든 경제 주체의 경제활동 방식과 거래 절차·행위의 법적 규정까지 아우른다. 돈은 경제의 혈류이자 시스템이기 때문에 이런 광의의 해석이 가능하다. 실제 핀테크도 단지 돈을 빌려주는 것이 아닌, 송금·결제·보안·펀딩·자산관리·보험 등 폭넓은 분야를 담고 있다. 시대는 자본보다 기술·정보 중심 사회로 바뀌고 있다. 자본과 거래방식의 혁신, 디지털 플랫폼 경제의 대두는 중장기적으로 돈의 정체성 변화를 요구하고 있다. 다만 금융이란 시스템을 기술의 흐름에 오롯이 맡겼을 때 부담해야 하는 리스크가 너무 크다. 암호화폐는 2017~18년 거대한 거품을 일으킨 뒤 무너졌고, P2P·크라우드 펀딩은 숱한 투자자를 울렸다. 언제나 상황이 진심에 우선한다. 진정성 있는 수많은 정보기술(IT) 기업들이 금융 혁신을 위해 뛰었지만, 시장의 탐욕에 휘둘리다 사기꾼으로 내몰렸다. 핀테크는 금융소외 계층을 없애고, 사용자들이 비용·시간을 아끼도록 선진적 발전을 해야 하지만, 그 전에 인간의 탐욕을 제어하고 시스템을 지켜야 하는 의무가 있다. 핀테크 도입은 고차원 방정식이다. 이에 [이코노미스트]는 핀테크 분야의 세계적 조류와 한국의 발전 전략과 방향, 이해당사자들 간에 입장을 정리하고, 발전 방향을 모색했다.- 이코노미스트 편집부[정기구독] [콘텐트 구매]				[ⓒ 이코노미스트(jmagazine.joins.com) 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=243&aid=0000009926

'아데나소프트웨어'는 핀테크 기업들이 IT와 금융을 원활하게 통합할 수 있도록 지원하는 웹사이트 제작, 고객관리(CRM), 외환 거래, 트레이딩, 위험 관리 솔루션 등을 개발·공급하는 업체다.   30일 투자은행(IB) 업계에 따르면 아데나소프트웨어는 지난 28일 코스닥 상장예비심사를 청구했다. 심사에는 2달 가량 걸리는 만큼, 코스닥 상장 여부가 빠르면 8월께 확정될 것으로 보인다.   앞서 아데나소프트웨어는 지난 2월한국투자증권과 기업공개(IPO) 대표주관사 계약을 체결하고, 연내 코스닥 상장을 추진키로 했다. 자금 조달을 통해 우수한 기술 인력을 확보하고, 해외 영업을 확대하기 위해서다.   아데나소프트웨어는 해외 외환 관련 기업, 페이먼트(지급서비스) 기업들을 대상으로 자체 개발 금융 소프트웨어를 공급한다. 영국, 스위스 등의 유동성 공급자(liquidity provider, LP) 30여개 업체, 해외 외환 선물사들에게 원활한 호가를 제공하는 역할이다. 이들 기업들의 회사 운영에 필요한 고객관리 프로그램, 리스크 관리 프로그램, 펀드매니저들이 필요로 하는 프로그램 등도 제공한다.   고객들이 대부분 해외인 만큼, 수익도 유럽, 북미, 아시아, 오세아니아 등 전세계 고객에서 나온다. 이에 힘입어 2017년 이후 영업수익 및 당기순이익은 연평균 350% 이상 성장했다.   아데나소프트웨어 관계자는 "안정적인 기술력을 인정한 기존 고객사의 추가 물량 확대와 신규 영업을 통한 추가 계획 확대, 글로벌 핀테크 산업의 성장세를 감안할 때, 향후에도 고성장세를 이루어낼 수 있다고 판단하고 있다"고 말했다.   현재 아데나소프트웨어의 기업가치는 지난해 프리IPO 투자유치를 통해 평가받은 약 1500억원을 훌쩍 넘은 것으로 보인다. 당시 최대주주인 정승우 대표는 보유한 보통주 약 132만주 가량을 재무적투자자(FI)들에게 약 390억원에 매각한 바 있다. 주당 2만9000원 수준 거래다.   투자에 참여한 투자자들로는 에이티넘인베스트먼트, 한국투자파트너스, 프리미어파트너스, 컴퍼니케이파트너스, 타임폴리오자산운용, 코너스톤에쿼티파트너스, 한국투자증권 등 7곳이 있다.   정 대표는 벤처캐피탈(VC) 출신으로 외환거래·페이먼트사에 대한 투자검토를 하면서 해당 업체들의 소프트웨어에 대한 수요를 확인하고 직접 회사를 설립했다.    ggg@fnnews.com 강구귀 기자   ▶ 헉! 소리나는 스!토리 뉴스 [헉스]▶ '아는 척'하고 싶은 당신을 위한 [두유노우]  ※ 저작권자 ⓒ 파이낸셜뉴스. 무단 전재-재배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=014&aid=0004434006

2020.02.27.	연합뉴스	[PRNewswire] 디지털 전문업체 Microland, 웨스트 미들랜즈에 유럽 본사 설립	(버밍엄, 잉글랜드 2020년 2월 27일 PRNewswire=연합뉴스) 26일, 인도 굴지의 디지털 IT 변혁 기업 Microland가 유럽 고객에게 서비스를 지원하고자 영국 버밍엄에 최첨단 디지털 허브를 개설했다. Bourneville을 기반으로 하는 이 시설은 Microland의 유럽 공유 서비스 본사(European Shared Services Headquarters)가 될 예정이다. 이 시설이 본격적으로 운영되면 최대 200명의 Microland 직원을 수용할 것으로 예상된다. 이 시설은 웨스트 미들랜즈를 중심으로 하는 Microland의 야심 찬 글로벌 성장 전략의 일환으로, Microland의 영국 및 유럽 서비스 제공 기능을 통합할 예정이다. 이 시설의 주된 목적은 '디지털 실현(Making Digital Happen)' 서비스를 통해 Microland의 전 세계 고객을 지원하는 것이다. 이 디지털 허브를 통해 제공되는 서비스 범위는 클라우드와 데이터센터 변혁, 소프트웨어 정의 네트워크, 사이버 보안, 디지털 직장 및 산업 IoT 등을 포함할 예정이다. 이 시설은 웨스트 미들랜즈에 들어선 Microland의 두 번째 디지털 허브다. 첫 번째 디지털 허브는 2018년 1월에 설립됐다. 이 새로운 디지털 허브는 롱브릿지에 위치한 Microland의 기존 기지와 함께 운영될 예정이다. Microland의 롱브릿지 기지는 Microland 고객들에게 차별화된 글로벌 서비스 제공 모델을 제시하는 고객 체험센터로 변신할 예정이다. Microland 설립자이자 회장 겸 상무이사 Pradeep Kar는 다음과 같이 언급했다."자사의 웨스트 미들랜즈 디지털 허브는 세계 곳곳에 설립한 허브들로 구성된 자사의 네트워크에 추가된 흥미진진하고 새로운 디지털 허브이자, 자사의 유럽 사업을 위한 중요한 이정표다. 이 센터는 특히 영국 고객에게 초점을 맞추고, 자사의 국제 고객 기반에 혁신적이고 현대적인 기업 솔루션을 제공할 예정이다.""자사는 사업 확장을 위해 여러 위치를 평가했고, 그 결과 웨스트 미들랜즈가 확실한 선택이라고 판단했다. 주요 기업으로 구성된 활기 넘치는 에코시스템, 기술적으로 숙련된 디지털 인재에 대한 접근성, 세계적 수준의 기반시설을 갖춘 이 지역은 기술 핵심지가 됐다. 이는 점점 더 증가하는 자사 국제 고객의 수요를 충족시키는 데 있어 매우 중요하다."Microland는 이 지역의 더 광범위한 전문 서비스 기술 기반을 이용할 계획이며, Microland의 투자로 기술과 사업 운영 분야 모두에서 고용 기회가 창출될 전망이다. 이 지역은 헌신적인 웨스트 미들랜즈 인도 파트너십을 구축하고자 하며, 이 시점에 새로운 디지털 허브가 설립됐다. 웨스트 미들랜즈 인도 파트너십은 인도 시장에서 투자와 방문객을 유치한 이 지역의 성공적인 기록을 바탕으로 West Midlands Growth Company*가 운영하는 프로그램이다. West Midlands Growth Company 사장 Neil Rami는 다음과 같이 언급했다."AI, 사이버 보안, 핀테크 및 게임 같은 여러 전문 영역이 빠르게 성장함에 따라, 웨스트 미들랜즈는 런던을 제외하고 영국에서 가장 큰 기술 및 디지털 부문이 됐다. 이 지역의 혁신적인 인재풀은 투자자로부터 동급 최고로 계속 인정받고 있으며, 런던 같은 도시보다 상대적으로 비용이 낮아 더 큰 매력으로 다가가고 있다.""Microland의 투자는 성장 중인 이 지역의 디지털 경제를 방증하는 중요한 투자다. 또한, 이는 인도 시장에서 활동을 증대하고 있는 이유를 보여주는 좋은 예이기도 하다. 인도는 이 지역에서 두 번째로 많은 FDI 일자리를 창출하고 있다. Microland와 같은 주요 성공 사례와 관계를 구축하는 것은 이 지역이 경제적 성공을 거두는 데 있어 핵심이 될 것이다."웨스트 미들랜즈는 런던과 사우스 이스트를 제외하고 해외 직접 투자(Foreign Direct Investment, FDI)를 유치하는 영국의 주요 지역이며, 기술과 디지털 업체가 주로 신규 프로젝트를 수주하고 있다. 영국 기반의 주요 기업 중에서 이 지역에 투자한 사례로는 The Economist Group을 들 수 있다. 최근 The Economist Group은 버밍엄에서 런던을 제외하고 영국에서 첫 신규 기술 혁신 유닛을 개설했다. 운송서비스 업체 Genesee & Wyoming은 또 다른 사례다. 세계적인 기업 Genesee & Wyoming은 이 지역에서 고가치 공유 서비스 기능을 구축했다. 컨테이너 화물열차를 운행하는 Genesee & Wyoming은 처음에 이 지역에 3천만 파운드를 투자했고, 100개의 새로운 일자리를 창출했다. 버밍엄 시의회 위원장 Ian Ward는 "Microland는 다른 국제 도시를 뒤로 하고 버밍엄에 자리를 잡은 주요 국제 기업 중 최신 사례"라며 "버밍엄은 기술 업체에 적합한 환경을 조성하고자 적극적으로 투자하고 있다"고 밝혔다. 그는 "버밍엄의 5G 시험대는 버밍엄이 혁신을 촉진하고자 준비하는 여러 사례 중 하나에 불과하다"라면서 "앞으로 전 세계 고객 기반에 첨단 디지털 솔루션을 제공하는 Microland의 성장 여정을 지원할 계획"이라고 덧붙였다.Microland의 새로운 디지털 허브는 'Official Sensitive', CES+ 및 ISO 27000 같은 엄격한 보안 기준을 준수한다. 그뿐만 아니라 고객 요건에 따라 영국 내무성 허가를 포함해 가장 수준 높은 직원 허가 기준을 통과한 직원을 고용할 예정이다. Microland 소개    Microland는 디지털 서비스를 제공하고, '디지털 실현'을 통해 기술이 더 많은 작업을 수행하고, 그와 동시에 더 적게 방해하도록 지원한다. Microland는 고객이 더 쉽게 차세대 디지털 기반시설을 채택하도록 돕는다. 이를 위해 클라우드와 데이터센터, 네트워크, 디지털 직장, 사이버 보안 및 산업 IoT에 관한 자사의 전문지식을 이용한다. 우수성 수용을 보장하는 것은 예측 가능하고, 믿을 수 있으며, 안정적이다. 1989년에 설립됐으며, 인도 벵갈루루에 본사가 위치한 Microland는 아시아, 호주, 유럽, 중동 및 북미 사무실과 서비스 제공센터에서 4,500명이 넘는 디지털 전문가를 보유하고 있다. *West Midlands Growth Company 소개West Midlands Growth Company는 웨스트 미들랜즈가 국가와 국제 단위에서 성공을 거두도록 지원한다. West Midlands Growth Company의 주된 목적은 웨스트 미들랜즈로 투자, 일자리, 방문객 및 사업체를 유치하는 것이다. West Midlands Growth Company는 West Midlands Combined Authority(WMCA)의 전략적 경제 계획 시행을 지원하는 데 있어 중요한 역할을 수행한다. West Midlands Growth Company는 그레이터 버밍엄과 솔리헐, 코벤트리와 워릭셔 및 블랙 컨트리로 구성된 WMCA 지역에 초점을 맞춘다. 추가 정보는 웹사이트 https://wmgrowth.com/을 참조한다.로고: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/965328/Microland.jpg  출처: MicrolandGlobal Digital Specialist Microland Creates European Headquarters in the West MidlandsBIRMINGHAM, England, Feb. 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Microland, India's leading digital IT transformation company, today inaugurated its state-of-the-art Digital Hub in Birmingham, UK to serve its European customers.

2020.04.27.	머니S	KB국민카드, 태국 소비자금융 시장 진출… 이동철표 해외사업 속도	/사진=KB국민카드KB국민카드가 태국 소비자금융 시장에 진출한다. KB국민카드는 신용대출, 자동차대출 등 소비자 금융 사업을 영위하는 태국 여신전문금융회사 ‘제이 핀테크(J Fintech)’지분 인수를 위한‘신주인수계약’을 맺는다고 27일 밝혔다.계약은 신종 코로나바이러스 감염증(코로나19) 영향으로 한국과 태국 모두 외국인에 대한 입국 제한 조치가 취해진 상황에서 서울과 방콕을 온라인으로 연결해 화상 계약방식으로 진행됐다. 지분 인수 계약을 체결한 회사는 태국 내 휴대전화 유통과 채권 추심 1위 업체를 계열사로 보유한 제이마트(Jaymart) 그룹의 금융 자회사로 신용대출‧자동차대출 등 대출 사업과 신용카드 사업을 영위할 수 있다.2011년 설립된 이 회사는 임직원 130여명에 18개 영업소를 보유하고 있다. 지난해 말 기준 총자산 1516억원‧당기순이익 26억원을 기록한 중견 여신전문금융회사다. 총 인수 대금은 248억원(6억5000만 바트)으로 KB국민카드는 제이 핀테크의 의결권 지분 50.99%를 보유한다.이번 계약은 이동철 사장 부임 이후 진행된 캄보디아‧인도네시아에 이은 3번째 해외 금융회사 인수다. 이 사장이 올 초 신년사에서 언급한 동남아시아 국가를 중심으로 한 해외 사업의 지속 확장 전략에 한 층 가속도가 붙을 것으로 보인다. KB국민카드는 한국과 태국 금융 당국의 승인 절차와 인수 계약을 마무리하는 ‘딜 클로징’등을 거쳐 이르면 연말 공식 자회사로 편입할 계획이다.태국 소비자금융 시장은 2018년 기준 약 410조 원 규모로 추산되며 최근 5년 평균 8%에 이르는 성장세를 이어가고 있다, 정부의 캐시리스 정책에 힘입어 신용카드 시장도 연 평균 7% 이상 성장하는 등 신용카드를 비롯해 각종 신용 사업이 용이한 것으로 평가받고 있다. KB국민카드는 자회사 편입 후 본사의 지급 보증 등을 통한 자금 조달로 차입 비용 절감을 도모하고 기존 보유 자산의 건전성을 높이는 등 우량 자산 중심의 포트폴리오 재편 작업을 진행할 계획이다.특히 영업 인프라 강화와 영업 채널 다각화를 위해 제이마트 그룹의 자회사인 ‘제이마트 모바일’이 보유한 전국 192개 매장을 전속시장으로 활용하고 전국 주요 거점 지역을 중심으로 영업소도 지속적으로 확대할 방침이다.KB국민카드의 축적된 ▲상품 ▲디지털 ▲정보기술(IT) 관련 노하우를 바탕으로 현지 고객에 최적화된 신용 대출 신상품과 다양한 디지털 기반의 상품을 선보이고 중장기적으로 신용카드 시장 진출을 도모해 수익성을 올릴 계획이다.KB국민카드 관계자는 “태국시장 진출은 현지 금융회사 인수를 위한 2년여의 준비 작업이 결실을 맺게 된 것”이라며 “이번에 인수한 회사를 10년 내 태국 최상위 소비자 금융회사로 도약시키는 등 동남아시아 주요 국가에서도 KB국민카드만의 해외 진출 성공 스토리를 계속해서 이어갈 것”이라고 강조했다.진은혜 기자 verdad89@mt.co.kr▶ 고수들의 재테크 비법 영상▶거품 뺀 솔직 시승기 ▶ 코로나19 속보 <저작권자 ⓒ '성공을 꿈꾸는 사람들의 경제 뉴스' 머니S, 무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=417&aid=0000535875

2020.04.22.	코리아헤럴드	Crowdfunding platform Wadiz launches offline space to showcase products	An interior view of Gonggan Wadiz in eastern Seoul. (Wadiz)South Korean crowdfunding platform Wadiz said Wednesday it has launched an offline space to help fundraising efforts by showcasing products to visitors and funders. Located in eastern Seoul, Gonggan Wadiz features a display room for “makers,” or those with an ongoing fundraising project on the Wadiz platform, as well as a workstation and networking space, officials said. Visitors and funders will be able to try the products before they invest in a project, they added. The two-story building has 1,133 square meters in floor space and includes a rooftop area and basement floor. Makers will be able to put their products up for display while they raise funds, in exchange for an undisclosed commission fee to Wadiz.Wadiz founder and Chief Executive Shin Hye-sung said the space is meant to amplify the makers’ influence on customers.“From the early stage of Wadiz, makers have hoped to have an offline space for themselves,” Shin said. “That‘s how we wanted to create a space where funders and makers can mingle and communicate with each other.”The Wadiz platform allows funders to invest in either rewards-based crowdfunding or equity crowdfunding projects. The fintech startup is owned by Shin and venture capital Neoplux, among others.Headquartered in Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province, Wadiz recorded a net loss of 29.22 billion won ($23.63 million) and 9.89 billion won in operating loss for 2019. Shin said the startup has postponed its plan to go public to next year due to market uncertainties across the globe.

2020.01.13.	헤럴드경제	지난해 P2P 수익률 6~15%…부동산·매출채권 투자 성과	테라펀딩·어니스트·피플펀드최고수익처는 건물신축 관련전문가 “손실위험 꼭 살펴야”[헤럴드경제=홍태화 기자] 주요 P2P업체가 내놓은 상품이 지난해 평균 두자릿수의 수익률을 기록했다. 2019년 만기 상품을 기준으로 최고는 15%에 달했고, 최저도 6%대로 나타났다.13일 테라펀딩, 어니스트펀드, 피플펀드 등 3개 P2P업체가 제공한 수익률 자료를 보면 평균 10~12%였다. 어니스트펀드는 누적 수익률을 기준으로, 나머지 2개사는 2019년 만기상품 기준이다.최고수익 상품에는 부동산 관련 자금 융통 상품이 많았다. 테라펀딩은 이천호반베르디움 인근 근린생활시설 상품으로, 어니스트펀드는 김포테라스테이준공자금 상품으로 15%의 수익률을 올렸다. 부동산 시장이 활황을 보이면서 P2P업체를 통한 자금융통도 활발해지는 모습이다. 이날 기준 테라펀딩과 어니스트펀드과 올라온 투자상품도 경의중앙선 운정역 인근 근린생활시설 신축사업 등으로 대부분 부동산 관련 상품이었다.최저 수익을 기록한 SCF상품은 저위험 상품으로 분류됐다. 피플펀드에선 이커머스 선정산 상품이라는 이름으로 비슷한 상품이 팔렸다. 수익률은 6%로 동일하다. SCF 상품은 온라인 쇼핑 플랫폼에 입점한 판매업체의 매출채권에 투자하는 개념이다. P2P업체는 판매업체의 매출채권을 기반해 미리 정산 금액을 주고, 이후 구매기업으로부터 정산을 직접 받는다. 이 과정에서 투자자는 P2P업체로부터 수익금을 얻는다. 최근 라임자산운용 무역금융 펀드와 유사한 구조다. 매출채권이 믿을만한지가 핵심이다.P2P상품은 저금리 기조와 정부의 핀테크(Fintech) 지원 기류 속에서 성장했다. 2015년 말 373억원이었던 P2P금융 누적대출액은 지난해 6월 기준 6조2000억원으로 급증했다. 올해에는 ‘온라인투자연계금융업법(P2P금융법)’이 본격적으로 시행되면서 제도권 내로 편입될 전망이다.P2P업계에서 올해 부동산 관련 상품을 계속해 강화하면서 중금리 대출 서비스에도 집중할 것으로 전해졌다. 외식업계 등 소상공인에게 직접 투자하는 P2P상품도 계속해 나오고 있다. 8퍼센트는 개인신용대출과 함께 유망 스타트업과 소상공인 투자상품을 투자자에게 연결하고 있다.식품회사 납품 업체인 한솔프라임 관련 상품은 18%의 수익을 올렸다. 음식점 자연별곡 투자상품은 4.59%의 수익률을 거뒀다.다만 전문가들은 주의해야 할 점으로 ▷업체의 금융감독원 등록 유무 ▷원금 손실 가능성에 대한 고지 준수 여부 ▷투자 예치금을 은행 등에 별도 예치하는지 여부 등을 조언했다. 특히 ‘분산투자’가 가장 중요한 대원칙으로 꼽힌다. 예금처럼 원금이 보장되는 상품이 아니기 때문에 고수익이 예상된다고 한 상품에 투자액을 몰아넣어선 안 된다는 충고다.th5@heraldcorp.com▶네이버에서 헤럴드경제 채널 구독하기▶제49회 헤럴드 전국 영어 말하기대회 ▶헤럴드경제 사이트 바로가기 - Copyrights ⓒ 헤럴드경제 & heraldbiz.com, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지 -	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=016&aid=0001623322

2020.01.24.	스포츠서울	로저버가 이끄는 비트코인닷컴, 국내 분산금융 업체 '트러스트버스'와 맞손	삼성전자와도 협력하고 있는 트러스트버스의 TRV 토큰이 비트코인닷컴 거래소에 상장된다.  제공 | 트러스트버스[스포츠서울 이상훈 기자] 차세대 DeFi(Decentralized Finance, 분산금융) 기업 트러스트버스의 TRV 토큰이 비트코인닷컴 거래소에 상장된다.트러스트버스는 국내 유명 DeFi 기업으로, 블록체인 및 AI 기반의 다양한 금융 솔루션을 제공한다. 퓨처라마 블록체인 써밋(Futurama Blockchain Summit)에서 우승을 하며 이름을 알리기 시작했고, 지난해에는 삼성 블록체인 키스토어(Samsung Blockchain Keystore) 디앱(DApp) 리스트에 자사 암호화폐시장 분석 솔루션인 주피터(Jupiter)와 보안성이 뛰어난 암호화폐 지갑 마스(Mars)를 올린 바 있다. 이 외에도 MWC, 삼성 개발자 컨퍼런스(SDC19), 싱가포르 핀테크 페스티벌(Singapore Fintech Festival) 등에도 참여하며 블록체인 업계는 물론 IT 업계에서 그 입지를 굳혀가고 있는 스타트업이다. 싱가포르에도 기반을 두고 있는 이 기업은 최근 싱가포르통화청(MAS)이 그 시행일자를 이달 안으로 확정한 지불서비스법의 요건을 충족하기 위해 디지털결제 토큰 라이선스(Payment token license) 취득 절차를 밟고 있는 것으로 알려졌다.비트코인닷컴은 블록체인 투자자이자 사업가인 로저버(Roger Ver)가 2015년 설립한 종합 블록체인 업체다. 지난해 8월부터 CEO직을 역임한 스테판 러스트(Stefan Rust)의 지휘 아래 비트코인 지갑과 클라우드 마이닝, 비트코인 간편구매, 블록체인 미디어 등 다양한 사업을 운영하고 있다. TRV 토큰이 상장되는 것으로 알려진 비트코인닷컴의 거래 플랫폼은 지난해 9월, ‘exchange.bitcoin.com’이라는 이름으로 출범하였다.비트코인닷컴 거래소에 상장되는 토큰들은 대부분 비트코인닷컴과의 전략적 파트너십 관계 형성을 목표로 하는 경우가 많아, 업계에서는 이번 상장 역시도 비트코인닷컴과 트러스트버스의 파트너십이 그 배경이 된 것으로 보고 있다. 예로 올 초 출시를 앞둔 트러스트버스의 디지털 자산 분실 방지 서비스인 ‘Nova’를 비트코인닷컴의 월렛에 탑재하거나, 고부가가치 상품에 대한 커머스 플랫폼인 ‘Canvas’에 비트코인, 비트코인캐시 등의 페이먼트 기능을 추가하는 형식의 협력관계일 것으로 추정되나 아직 공식적인 발표는 따로 확인되지 않고 있다. 다만, 트러스트버스 정기욱 대표의 일정상, 스위스 세계경제포럼(다보스 포럼) 참석, 파리 유네스코와의 미팅 이후 런던에서 직접 비트코인닷컴의 경영진과 미팅을 가질 것으로 알려지면서 향후 사업적 제휴 또는 협업에 따른 파트너십 내용이 그 윤곽을 드러낼 것으로 기대되고 있다.트러스트버스의 정기욱 대표 역시도 “이번 상장은 단순 거래소 상장의 의미보다는 비트코인닷컴과의 전략적 파트너십의 단초로서의 측면이 강하다”고 밝히며, “파트너십이 체결되면, 보다 실생활에서 활용할 수 있는 블록체인 금융 서비스를 제공할 수 있을 것”이라며 기대를 보였다.트러스트버스의 TRV 토큰은 1월 28일 비트코인닷컴 거래소에 정식 상장된다. party@sportsseoul.com[기사제보 news@sportsseoul.com]  Copyright ⓒ 스포츠서울&sportsseoul.com	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=105&oid=468&aid=0000618878
2020.03.08.	매일신문	[금융칼럼] 대학 새내기의 똑똑한 금융생활 길라잡이	대학 새내기들은 성인이 되면서 청소년기까지 받았던 많은 금융생활의 제재와 제약들로부터 자유로워지고, 아르바이트나 취업을 하면서 용돈 이외의 수입으로 이전에 비해 더 많은 소비를 할 수 있게 된다.이미 온라인과 스마트폰에 익숙한 세대인 대학 새내기들은 기존 현금으로 거래하며 예·적금 등 안전한 금융상품을 이용하던 과거의 금융방식에서 벗어나 최근 새롭게 개발되는 다양한 핀테크(FinTech·금융과 IT의 결합) 상품이나 스마트폰을 이용한 디지털금융 등 금융 패러다임의 변화에 보조를 맞추는 것이 유리하다.반면 상대적으로 부족한 금융 관련 지식으로 인해 보이스피싱, 스미싱, 고금리 대출 등의 금융범죄와 금융사기의 위험에 더 많이 노출될 위험성도 높아진다는 점을 간과해서는 안된다. 특히 온라인 거래의 편리함 만큼 사소한 실수나 잘못된 의사결정으로 인해 심각한 경제적 손실을 가져올 가능성은 더욱 높아진다.이런 상황에서 대학 새내기들의 합리적인 금융선택 및 금융역량 강화를 위한 몇가지 팁(Tip)을 소개하고자 한다.요즘 대학교 학생증은 단순히 신분증의 기능을 넘어 금융기관과의 제휴를 통해 신용카드, 체크카드, 교통카드 등의 복합적인 기능들이 포함돼 있다. 새내기들은 가능하면 신용카드 보다는 체크카드를 사용하는 편이 충동구매를 방지하고 건전한 소비습관을 갖는데 도움이 된다.대학생들의 한 달 평균 생활비는 보통 40만~50만원 정도로 통신비, 식대, 교통비 등의 지출이 많다. 본인의 한 달 수입과 지출을 꼼꼼하게 파악해 정해진 범위 내에서의 계획성 있는 소비를 하는 것이 중요하다.최근 경기 침체로 인해 학비나 생활비 부담이 증가하면서 학자금 및 생활비 대출을 받는 학생들이 5명 중 1명에 달한다고 한다.만약 학자금 대출을 받아야 한다면 한국장학재단을 이용하는 것이 좋다. 생활비 대출이 필요할 경우에는 은행권의 저금리 대출이나 신용회복위원회 대학생 햇살론 등을 활용하는 것이 고금리 대출 및 불법 사금융 피해를 줄일 수 있는 방안이다.여기서 한발 더 나아가 다양한 금융정보와 지식을 갖길 원한다면 금융감독원과 각 금융기관에서 주최하는 금융프로그램 및 금융아카데미 등에 참여해 다양한 금융관련 정보들을 깊이있게 습득하는 것도 똑똑한 금융생활을 위한 좋은 기회가 될 것이다.권윤경 NH농협은행 대구본부 마케팅추진단 차장한윤조 기자 hanyunjo@imaeil.com▶ 네이버에서 매일신문 구독하기▶ 매일신문 네이버TV 바로가기ⓒ매일신문 - www.imaeil.com	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=088&aid=0000637304
2020.02.06.	매경닷컴	한화금융 계열사, 디지털전환 가속화…새 성과관리체계 `OKR` 도입	한화금융 계열사(생명, 손해보험, 투자증권, 자산운용)가 디지털 트랜스포메이션의 일환으로 새 성과관리체계인 'OKR(Objective and Key Results)'을 도입한다고 6일 밝혔다.OKR은 IT기업이나 스타트업에서 사용하고 있지만 국내 금융사에서는 낯선 지표다. 앞서 김승연 한화그룹 회장은 올해 신년사에서 "전사차원의 디지털 트랜스포메이션을 가속화해 4차 산업혁명 시대의 경쟁력을 적극 확보해야 한다"고 강조한 바 있다. OKR은 '어떤 방향으로 갈 것인가(Objective)'와 '그곳에 가고 있다는 것을 어떻게 알 수 있는지(Key results)'의 합성어로 변화하는 환경에 맞춰 지속적으로 추적하고 변화해가는 새로운 성과관리체계다.구글, 유튜브, 페이스북 등 포춘 500대 글로벌 기업의 25%가 실행하고 있다. 특히, 40명의 소수 조직이었던 구글이 글로벌 기업으로 성장하는데 결정적 요인인 것으로 알려져 있다. 한화금융 계열사는 OKR을 도입하기에 앞서 지난해부터 특정업무 단위에 애자일(Agile) 업무 방식 도입을 추진했다. 주요 금융 계열사인 한화생명은 미래전략실, 기술전략실, 글로벌네트워크본부 등 미래혁신을 추진하는 주요 본부를 애자일 조직으로 운영해 오고 있으며 한화투자증권도 애자일 혁신실을 신설했다.OKR의 가장 큰 특징은 기존 성과관리지표인 KPI(Key Performance Indicator)에 비해 스피드를 최대한 끌어 올렸다는 것이다. KPI는 연 단위 평가인데 비해 OKR은 짧게는 수 주, 길게는 분기단위로 목표관리가 가능하다. 대내외 환경에 민첩하게 대응할 수 있어 디지털 혁신 시대에 가장 적합한 지표로 평가 받고 있다. 또 OKR은 회사가 먼저 목표를 정하면 부서와 직원이 자발적으로 목표를 설정하는 쌍방향 방식이다. 반면 KPI는 주로 Top down(하향식)으로 목표 수립이 이뤄진다. 한화금융 계열사 관계자는 "핀테크(FinTech)가 아닌 테크핀(TechFin)이라는 말이 나올 정도로 디지털 기술이 금융업 전반을 견인한다고 볼 수 있다"며 "이번 전사적 OKR 도입으로 새로운 환경에 유연하게 대응함으로써 한화금융 계열사들의 디지털 트랜스포메이션이 가속화 될 것"이라고 말했다.[디지털뉴스국 류영상 기자]▶기사공유하고 코인적립하세요 'M코인'▶네이버 메인에서 '매일경제'를 받아보세요 ▶뉴스레터 '매콤달콤' 구독[ⓒ 매일경제 & mk.co.kr, 무단전재 및 재배포 금지]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=009&aid=0004513169
2020.04.11.	중앙선데이	증권업 날개 다는 ‘테크핀’…떨고있는 금융·증권 ‘핀테크’	규제 완화 계기로 진출 경쟁 가속카카오 증권 계좌 한달 새 50만 건비바리퍼블리카도 하반기에 진출2030 신규 고객 확보 잠재력 커금융·증권사와 생존 다툼 치열지난 달 18일 금융위원회는 정례회의에서 토스준비법인의 투자중개업 예비인가를 의결했다. 지난해 말 설립된 이 법인의 최대주주는 1600만 회원을 확보한 모바일 간편송금 서비스 ‘토스’를 운영하는 비바리퍼블리카다. 이로써 비바리퍼블리카는 지난해 인터넷전문은행 진출을 승인받은 데 이어 증권업 진출까지 눈앞에 두게 됐다. 본인가만 나면 올 하반기 영업에 나설 수 있다.        박재민 토스준비법인 대표는 “첫 투자 고객도 편리하게 쓸 수 있는 새로운 증권 서비스를 선보일 것”이라고 밝혔다. 2013년 설립된 비바리퍼블리카는 불과 5년 만에 ‘유니콘 기업(기업가치 1조원 이상 비상장 스타트업)’이 됐을 만큼 급성장했다.    #이뿐 아니다. 모바일 간편결제·송금·청구서 등의 서비스로 3000만 회원을 보유한 카카오페이(카카오 자회사)도 최근 증권업에 뛰어들었다. 카카오페이는 2018년 바로투자증권 인수를 결정하고 지난해 지분 60%를 취득하면서 대주주 변경 승인을 신청, 올 2월 금융위의 인수자격 심사를 통과했다. 직후 카카오페이증권이라는 새 이름으로 증권 계좌 유치에 나섰다. 한 달 만인 지난 달 25일 계좌 개설 건수가 50만건을 넘어섰다. 카카오페이의 지난해 매출은 1411억원으로 전년(695억원) 대비 배 이상으로 늘었다.        그래픽=박춘환 기자 park.choonhwan@joongang.co.kr            비바리퍼블리카·카카오페이 같은 테크핀(TechFin) 기업이 약진하고 있다. 일반 금융업에 이어 증권업에까지 영역을 넓히고 있다. 테크핀은 핀테크(FinTech)와 비슷하면서도 다른 개념이다. 정보통신기술(ICT) 기반의 금융 서비스라는 점에선 동일하지만 핀테크는 주로 금융사가 서비스의 주체인 경우다. 기존 금융 서비스 이용자를 대상으로 하되 ICT 인프라는 아웃소싱으로 구축한 경우가 많다. 시중은행의 모바일 뱅킹 애플리케이션이 대표적이다. 이와 달리 테크핀은 ICT 기업이 주도하는 금융 서비스다. ICT 인프라를 자체 보유하고 플랫폼 이용자 대상의 서비스를 추구해 핀테크와는 차이가 있다. 중국 최대 전자상거래 기업 알리바바의 창업주 마윈 전 회장이 2016년 처음 정의했다.      국내에서는 삼성전자가 테크핀에서 두각을 보이고 있는 대표주자다. 삼성전자는 2015년 미국 스타트업 루프페이를 인수, 이 회사 특허 기술을 기반으로 모바일 간편결제 서비스 ‘삼성페이’를 만들어 운영 중이다. 2015년 ‘갤럭시S6’를 시작으로 이후에 나온 삼성전자 스마트폰 대부분에 기본 탑재했다. 지난해 누적 결제액 40조원을 넘어섰다. 이 외에도 ‘네이버페이’의 네이버와 ‘페이코’의 NHN페이코, ‘스마일페이’의 이베이코리아 등이 이용자 급증에 따른 매출 증가세를 누리고 있다. 성장성을 확인한 다른 ICT 스타트업도 후발주자로 테크핀 시장에 속속 뛰어들고 있다.      ICT 업계는 최근 테크핀 기업의 증권업 진입에 대한 금융당국의 규제 완화를 계기로 이들 간 진출 경쟁이 가속화할 것으로 본다. 증권업으로 더욱 다양한 사업 포트폴리오와 수익선을 갖출 수 있어서다. 대기업이면서 수익선이 다양한 삼성전자가 아닌 테크핀 전문 업체들은 주로 플랫폼에서 발생하는 결제·광고 수수료로 대부분의 수익을 얻는다.        그러나 수년간 급격히 커진 몸집과, 비례해서 매년 늘고 있는 각종 비용 부담에 비해 마진이 덜 남는 장사였다. 실제 비바리퍼블리카와 카카오페이는 예년에 이어 지난해도 적자(영업손실)를 면치 못했다.        증권업을 하면 수수료 수익 외에도 종합자산관리계좌(CMA)와 머니마켓펀드(MMF) 같은 직접적인 기업·소비자 간 거래(B2C)로 수익 증대, 플랫폼 내 자금 유입 효과 등을 기대할 수 있다. 이동훈 KB증권 연구원은 “마케팅 비용이 많이 드는 결제·송금 등 저(低)마진 사업 비중이 줄면서 손익 구조가 개선되는 효과가 있을 것”으로 분석했다.    #게다가 테크핀 기업은 20~30대를 주식 투자의 세계로 유인해 신규 수요로 확보할 수 있는 잠재력이 기성 증권사들보다 큰 것으로 분석된다. 현재 국내 주식 투자 인구가 500만 명 수준인데 그중 20~30대 비중은 25%가량에 불과하다. 테크핀은 플랫폼 이용자 다수가 스마트폰 등 ICT 활용에 능하고 관심 많은 20~30대라 틈새시장 개척이 상대적으로 쉽다. 카카오페이의 50만 계좌를 개설 분석한 결과 20~30대가 전체의 68.4%를 차지했다.      전문가들은 테크핀의 성장세가 이어지면서 금융·증권업 판도 역시 요동칠 것으로 전망한다. 기업들이 인공지능·블록체인처럼 테크핀에 유용하게 접목할 수 있는 최신 ICT 분야에 대한 투자를 늘리면서 기술력을 쌓는 한편, 금융 노하우도 축적하고 있어 수요의 중심축이 이동할 수밖에 없다는 분석이다.        거꾸로 금융·증권 업계는 비상이 걸렸다. 이효섭 자본시장연구원 연구위원은 “ICT 기업들의 (테크핀에 대한) 잇단 투자와 영역 확대 이면에서 금융·증권사들은 더 치열한 생존 경쟁에 내몰렸다는 고민을 안게 됐다”며 “지금껏 핀테크 관련 신사업을 발굴하려는 노력이 부족했다면 해외 사례 벤치마킹 등을 통한 개선이 필요할 것”이라고 말했다.      이창균 기자 smilee@joongang.co.kr▶ 중앙SUNDAY [홈페이지]▶ [네이버포스트] [PDF열람]ⓒ중앙SUNDAY(https://news.joins.com/sunday) and 중앙일보(https://joongang.co.kr) 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=353&aid=0000036599
2020.01.19.	서울경제	[기고] 급속히 퍼지는 테크핀 금융혁신	■ 오정근 한국금융ICT융합학회장알리바바·텐센트·그랩·아마존 등금융산업서 새 먹거리 캐기 활발韓, 금산분리 탓 융복합·증자 한계시대착오적 금산분리 규제 완화를[서울경제] 규모가 큰 정보통신기술(ICT) 기업을 빅테크(BigTech) 또는 테크자이언트라고 한다. 근래 빅테크 기업들의 모바일 플랫폼을 이용한 금융산업 공세가 무서울 정도로 확산하고 있다. 이처럼 빅테크 기업과 금융이 융합된 산업을 테크핀(TechFin)이라고 한다. 종래의 핀테크(FinTech)는 금융사 중심으로 금융서비스를 모바일로 금융회사 고객들에게 제공하는 형태였다. 이 경우 고객은 금융회사 고객에 한정되기 마련이다. 반면 테크핀은 ICT 기업 중심으로 모바일 사용자들에게 금융서비스를 제공하는 것이다. 기술도 빅테크 기업들이 혁신적이고 대부분의 모바일 사용자들이 고객이 될 수 있으므로 고객을 더 많이 확보할 수 있는 장점이 있다. 이 때문에 많은 글로벌 빅테크 기업들이 금융산업에 활발하게 진출하고 있다.지난 2017년 KT와 카카오가 각각 인터넷전문은행 케이뱅크과 카카오뱅크를 설립하고, 최근 토스가 제3 인터넷전문은행 설립 예비인가를 받은 것이나 토스·네이버·카카오·쿠팡·삼성 등이 모바일결제 서비스업에 진출한 것이 대표적이다. 모바일결제서비스는 국내에만 한정되지 않는다. 많은 빅테크 기업들이 지난해부터 해외송금서비스업에도 진출하기 시작했다. 한국에서 가장 큰 사건은 아마도 네이버가 지난해 11월 네이버파이낸셜을 설립해 증권 보험업에 진출하기로 한 것이다. 이는 빅테크 기업이 금융지주회사를 설립해 금융산업에 진출하려는 전략이라는 점에서 눈에 띄는 전략이다. 네이버 일본 자회사 라인도 일본 손정의 회장의 소프트뱅크와 손잡고 금융지주회사를 설립하기로 했다. 이는 중국의 알리바바가 금융지주회사 앤트파이낸셜을 설립해 산하에 은행(마이뱅크) 증권·보험·카드 신용분석회사를 설립해 거의 모든 금융산업에 진출한 데 대한 대항전략이라고 볼 수 있다. 중국 징둥그룹도 산하 지주회사 징둥파이낸셜(징둥디지털과학기술로 개편)을 통해 금융 분야에 진출하고 있다. 이외에도 텐센트·바이두·샤오미 등 많은 빅테크 기업들이 금융업에 진출하고 있다. 싱가포르의 자동차공유회사 그랩은 지주회사 그랩파이낸셜을 설립해 공유자동차와 관련된 결제서비스와 보험 소액대출시장에 진출하고 있다. 일본에서도 통신 유통 전자상거래 기업들이 인터넷전문은행을 영위하고 있고 홍콩에서는 지난해 8개의 인터넷전문은행을 무더기로 인가하기도 했다. 미국에서도 우버가 우버머니를 설립해 당좌계좌를 제공하고 있고 구글·애플·아마존 등도 금융산업 진출을 준비하고 있다.이처럼 4차 산업혁명의 진전으로 급속히 발전하고 있는 빅테크 기업들이 모바일 플랫폼을 통해 각종 금융업에 진출하면서 금융의 판도도 바뀔 것으로 전망된다. 이는 대부분 국가에서는 금융과 산업이 융합하는 데 아무런 제약이나 규제가 없는 데 따른 결과다. 융복합이 활발하게 일어나면서 금융산업의 지형을 바꿔놓고 있는 것이다. 따라서 앞으로는 테크핀 융합에 따라가지 못하면 금융산업이 낙후할 수밖에 없다.그러나 한국에서는 엄격한 금산분리로 이미 영업 중인 두 개의 인터넷전문은행마저 증자에 애로를 겪고 있다. 규제에 막힌 네이버는 해외에서 나가 인터넷은행·모바일증권·모바일보험은 물론 암호화폐를 발행하고 암호화폐거래소도 운영하고 있다. 한국도 하루빨리 시대착오적인 금산분리 규제를 혁파해 많은 빅테크 기업들이 금융산업을 발전시키고 우수한 일자리를 많이 창출할 수 있는 길을 열어줄 수 있도록 해야 한다.[서울경제 바로가기]▶ '한 눈에 쏙' 새로워진 서울경제 모바일 페이지를 만나보세요.

2020.01.27.	헤럴드경제	프롭테크? 핀테크? 이제는 ‘프롭핀테크’가 온다	부동산 관련 핀테크 사업 활발증권 발행·투자 플랫폼·시세정보 제공[헤럴드경제=박자연 기자]기술로 무장한 일명 ‘테크’ 스타트업들이 시장 판도를 뒤흔들고 있다. 금융업과 부동산업도 예외는 아니다. 해당 업계에서 이제 핀테크(FinTech·금융과 기술이 결합한 서비스)와 프롭테크(PropTech·부동산과 기술을 결합한 서비스)는 선택이 아니라 필수다.이런 환경 변화 속, 부동산과 금융의 경계를 넘나드는 스타트업들이 속속 고개를 내밀고 있다.디지털 부동산 수익증권 유통플랫폼을 운영하는 ‘카사코리아’는 소액으로 상업용 부동산에 투자할 수 있는 서비스를 제공한다. 건물주가 보유한 건물을 상장 신청하면, 카사코리아가 블록체인 기반으로 디지털화된 자산유동화증권(DABS, Digital Asset Backed Security)을 공모주 형태로 발행한다. 궁극적으로 투자자들은 자신이 투자한 금액만큼 건물에 대한 지분을 갖는다.[금융위원회 제공]카사코리아는 지난해 12월 금융위원회 혁신금융사업자로 선정, 이르면 2월부터 KB국민은행·KEB하나은행·한국토지신탁·한국자산신탁·코람코자산신탁과 컨소시엄을 구성해 본격적으로 서비스를 펼칠 예정이다.개인 간(P2P) 금융 플랫폼 ‘테라펀딩’을 운영하는 테라핀테크 역시 중소형 건축주들에게 P2P 대출 형식으로 자금을 대출, 프롭테크와 핀테크의 경계를 허물고 있다.테라펀딩은 2014년 설립 이후 IBK기업은행, BNK경남은행, 동부저축은행 등 다수 금융사와 활발한 협업을 진행해왔다. 지난해 말 기준으로 누적 대출액 1조원을 넘기는 성과도 얻었다.한편 프롭테크에 보다 방점을 찍어 기존 부동산 시장에서 부실하게 제공됐던 정보의 빈틈을 메우고자 하는 업체도 있다.부동산 빅데이터 전문 기업 ‘빅밸류’는 그간 파악하기 어려웠던 연립·다세대주택의 시세정보를 빅데이터를 활용해 분석한다. 이를 바탕으로 빅밸류는 지난해 10월부터 KEB하나은행에 인공지능(AI) 주택 시세 서비스를 공급하는 중이다.부동산 실거래가 정보 플랫폼 ‘밸류맵’은 전국의 토지, 건물, 빌딩, 상가 등 주거용 부동산을 제외한 모든 부동산의 실거래가 정보를 보여준다. IBK기업은행의 중소기업 상생플랫폼(IBK박스) 부동산 공식 협력사로 선정된 밸류맵은 중소기업 사업자들이 산업용 부동산 정보를 더 폭넓게 활용할 수 있도록 질높은 서비스를 제공하겠다는 방침이다.nature68@heraldcorp.com▶채널 구독하면 신세계 상품권과 에어팟 프로를 쏜다▶호주대사관과 함께하는 헤럴드영어말하기대회 ▶헤럴드경제 사이트 바로가기 - Copyrights ⓒ 헤럴드경제 & heraldbiz.com, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지 -	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=016&aid=0001628264
2020.03.02.	디지털타임스	`혁신` 핀테크에… 은행 `특화 서비스`로 반격	애플·구글·아마존, 신속 대출로 편의성 ↑은행, 온라인대출 확대 디지털뱅크 탈바꿈"국내은행 고객관점서 맞춤서비스 제공해야"'핀테크 기업의 도전이냐 vs 기존 은행들의 응수냐.'핀테크 기업들의 기세가 날로 매서워지고 있다. 이들 기업들은 혁신과 간편함을 무기 삼아 본격적으로 금융업계 공략에 나서고 있는 데 따른 것이다. 애플은 지난해 8월 골드만삭스 및 마스터카드와 손잡고 애플카드를 선보였으며, 구글은 올해 미국 은행 씨티그룹과 손을 잡고 소비자에게 당좌예금 계좌를 제공할 예정이다.그러나 기존 은행들의 반격도 만만치 않다. 은행들은 핀테크 기업과의 각종 파트너십 체결에 나서며 각종 서비스를 선보이고 있기 때문이다. 인도의 SBI은행은 디지털플랫폼인 요노(YONO)를 개발해 협력 파트너사들의 금융상품 30여개를 판매하고 있으며, 호주뉴질랜드은행(ANZ)은 데이터 교환 및 협업을 위해 핀테크 사 투자에 나서고 있다.하나금융연구원은 지난 2일 이 같은 내용을 포함한 '2020년 은행업, 빅테크 기업의 도전 속 트렌드 변화 예상'이란 보고서를 통해 올해 금융권의 '핀테크 트렌드'를 소개했다.◇"2020년 빅테크 기업과 챌린저 뱅크 성장 촉진 두드러질 것"=보고서는 빅테크 기업들이 대출 서비스를 개인에서 기업대출까지 확대하는 등 본격적으로 금융시장에 진입함에 따라 핀테크(Fintech)를 넘은 테크핀(Techfin) 시대를 전망하고 있다고 밝혔다. 예컨대 핀테크는 은행 등 금융기관이 기존 금융서비스에 ICT를 도입하는 방식이라면, 테크핀은 ICT기업이 독자적인 기술을 바탕으로 한 차별화된 금융서비스를 가리키는 방식을 의미한다. 아마존은 2011년 선전기업 대상 운용자금 대출 서비스인 아마존 렌딩(Amazon Lending)을 출시했으며, 페이팔(Paypal)은 2013년 웹뱅크(WebBank)와 페이팔 워킹 캐피털(Paypal Working Capital)에 기업대출을 제공한 바 있다. 또 보고서는 챌린저 뱅크들도 신속한 대출 등 기존 은행이 충족시키기 어려운 서비스 등의 제공을 통해 고객 유지율을 향상시켜 은행업에서의 입지를 강화할 것으로 내다봤다. 미국 내 온라인 은행 스타트업인 바로(Varo) 등은 로보어드바이져 서비스를 출시해 고객 편의성을 높일 예정이다.◇핀테크 기업의 금융업 진출 가속화에…은행들 '반격' 또한 무시 못해=보고서는 은행들의 올해 온라인 대출 관련 핀테크 기업들과의 파트너십 결성이 증가할 것으로 전망했다. 온라인 대출 플랫폼 확장을 통해 디지털 선호 고객 이탈을 방지하겠다는 것이다. 앞서 영국계 투자은행 HSBC나 캐나다 TD 은행 등은 지난해 핀테크 기업 아마운트(Amount)를 통해 '디지털 대출 플랫폼을' 출시한 바 있다. 또한 보고서는 은행은 핀테크 기업에 맞서는 디지털 상품의 개발, 디지털 기술 발전에 대한 투자 및 지출 확대, '디지털 뱅커' 양성을 통한 인력구조의 재조정이 필요하다고 조언했다. 예컨대 세계 최대 투자은행인 JPMorgan은 IT 지출에 114억달러를 투입하고 있으나, 이 같은 비용은 아마존이 IT에 투입하는 288억달러에 비하면 절반 수준에 불과하다는 것이다. 미국의 은행들이 디지털화와 인력 자동화 실행 시 20205년까지 700억 달러의 비용 절감이 가능하다고 전했다. 아울러 디지털 원주민이라 불리는 Z세대(1995~2010년생)가 잠재적 주요 소비계층으로 부상하면서 이들 계층을 타겟팅한 특화된 서비스가 확대될 것으로 전망했다. ◇"국내 은행들, 새로은 트렌드에 따른 비즈 모델 적용해야"=보고서는 국내의 상황도 핀테크 기업들의 약진이 두드러지고 있다고 진단했다. 예컨대 네이버파이낸셜이 생활금융 플랫폼에 도전하고, 카카오페이는 증권업에 진출하는 등 빅테크 기업들의 움직임이 활발하게 이뤄지고 있다는 것이다. 네이버파이낸셜은 3000만명 가입자에게 통합자산관리, 주식 등 금융상품, 네이버쇼핑 후불결제, 일본에서 환전 없는 간편결제 등의 서비스를 제공할 예정이다. 이에 국내 은행들도 빅테크 기업 등의 진출 가속화에 대응해 고객 관점에서 고객이 원하는 상품 및 서비스를 적시에 편리하게 제공하는 변화의 노력이 필요하다고 지적했다.황병서기자 BShwang@dt.co.kr	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=029&aid=0002587495
2020.01.13.	헤럴드경제	P2P 작년 수익률 ‘최고 15%’…부동산·매출채권 투자 성과	테라펀딩·어니스트 등 10~12%전문가 “분산투자 대원칙 지켜야”주요 P2P업체가 내놓은 상품이 지난해 평균 두자릿수의 수익률을 기록했다. 2019년 만기 상품을 기준으로 최고는 15%에 달했고, 최저도 6%대로 나타났다.13일 테라펀딩, 어니스트펀드, 피플펀드 등 3개 P2P업체가 제공한 수익률 자료를 보면 평균 10~12%였다. 어니스트펀드는 누적 수익률을 기준으로, 나머지 2개사는 2019년 만기상품 기준이다.최고수익 상품에는 부동산 관련 자금 융통 상품이 많았다. 테라펀딩은 이천호반베르디움 인근 근린생활시설 상품으로, 어니스트펀드는 김포테라스테이준공자금 상품으로 15%의 수익률을 올렸다. 부동산 시장이 활황을 보이면서 P2P업체를 통한 자금융통도 활발해지는 모습이다. 이날 기준 테라펀딩과 어니스트펀드과 올라온 투자상품도 경의중앙선 운정역 인근 근린생활시설 신축사업 등으로 대부분 부동산 관련 상품이었다.최저 수익을 기록한 SCF상품은 저위험 상품으로 분류됐다. 피플펀드에선 이커머스 선정산 상품이라는 이름으로 비슷한 상품이 팔렸다. 수익률은 6%로 동일하다. SCF 상품은 온라인 쇼핑 플랫폼에 입점한 판매업체의 매출채권에 투자하는 개념이다. P2P업체는 판매업체의 매출채권을 기반해 미리 정산 금액을 주고, 이후 구매기업으로부터 정산을 직접 받는다. 이 과정에서 투자자는 P2P업체로부터 수익금을 얻는다. 최근 라임자산운용 무역금융 펀드와 유사한 구조다. 매출채권이 믿을만한지가 핵심이다.P2P상품은 저금리 기조와 정부의 핀테크(Fintech) 지원 기류 속에서 성장했다. 2015년 말 373억원이었던 P2P금융 누적대출액은 지난해 6월 기준 6조2000억원으로 급증했다. 올해에는 ‘온라인투자연계금융업법(P2P금융법)’이 본격적으로 시행되면서 제도권 내로 편입될 전망이다.P2P업계에서 올해 부동산 관련 상품을 계속해 강화하면서 중금리 대출 서비스에도 집중할 것으로 전해졌다. 외식업계 등 소상공인에게 직접 투자하는 P2P상품도 계속해 나오고 있다. 8퍼센트는 개인신용대출과 함께 유망 스타트업과 소상공인 투자상품을 투자자에게 연결하고 있다.식품회사 남품 업체인 한솔프라임 관련 상품은 18%의 수익을 올렸다. 음식점 자연별곡 투자상품은 4.59%의 수익률을 거뒀다.다만 전문가들은 주의해야 할 점으로 ▷업체의 금융감독원 등록 유무 ▷원금 손실 가능성에 대한 고지 준수 여부 ▷투자 예치금을 은행 등에 별도 예치하는지 여부 등을 조언했다. 특히 ‘분산투자’가 가장 중요한 대원칙으로 꼽힌다. 예금처럼 원금이 보장되는 상품이 아니기 때문에 고수익이 예상된다고 한 상품에 투자액을 몰아넣어선 안 된다는 충고다. 홍태화 기자▶네이버에서 헤럴드경제 채널 구독하기▶제49회 헤럴드 전국 영어 말하기대회 ▶헤럴드경제 사이트 바로가기 - Copyrights ⓒ 헤럴드경제 & heraldbiz.com, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지 -	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=016&aid=0001623462
2020.04.27.	매경닷컴	KB국민카드, 태국 금융시장 진출…국내 여신전문금융사 중 처음	KB국민카드가 태국 여신전문금융회사(여전사)를 인수해 태국 소비자 금융시장에 진출한다. 국내 카드사가 태국에 진출한 것은 처음이다. 국민카드는 캄보디아·인도네시아에 이어 태국에 진출해 동남아시아 시장을 더욱 키울 계획이다. KB국민카드는 태국 여전사 '제이 핀테크(J Fintech)' 의결권 지분 50.99%를 248억원(약 6억5000만바트)에 인수하는 신주인수계약을 맺었다고 27일 밝혔다. KB국민카드는 양국 금융당국 승인을 받는 대로 인수계약을 마무리한다. 이르면 올해 말 제이 핀테크는 KB국민카드 자회사로 편입된다.제이 핀테크는 태국 휴대전화 판매기업인 '제이마트(Jaymart)'의 금융 자회사다. 지난해 말 기준 제이 핀테크의 총자산은 1516억원, 당기순이익은 26억원이다.이번 인수로 KB국민카드는 태국에서 신용·자동차 대출 등 대출 사업과 신용카드 사업을 할 수 있다. KB국민카드는 신용카드 가맹점 수수료 인하 등으로 국내 카드업계 환경이 어려워지자 해외 시장을 적극적으로 발굴하고 있다.

2020.02.20.	정책브리핑	[해보니] 나, 전자문서지갑 가지고 다닌다~	요즘 생활 전반에서 종이 쓸 일이 점점 줄어들고 있다. 출력된 문서는 여전히 중요한 위상을 차지하고 있지만, 이 문서들이 계속해서 컴퓨터와 스마트폰 앱 속으로 들어가 ‘전자화’ 되고 있다.우리는 아직까지 민원 처리를 할 때 창구에 가서 직원과 대면하며 직접 서류를 발급받는 장면을 떠올리게 된다. 너무나도 익숙한 풍경이기 때문이다. 앞으로 그 당연한 ‘떠올림’이 점차 다른 이미지로 바뀌게 될 전망이다.불과 얼마 전까지만 해도 실물로 된 종이가 반드시 필요하다고 여겨졌던 주민등록등/초본과 건강보험 관련 확인서, 출입국사실증명서, 운전경력증명서. 이런 서류들을 앞으로는 굳이 출력하지 않아도 민원을 처리할 수 있는 시대가 불현듯 다가왔다.      전자증명서 발급 대상 증명서가 대폭 확대된다.(출처=행정안전부)   행정안전부는 작년 12월부터 주민등록등/초본 전자증명서 발급 시범사업에 이어, 2월 14일부터 ‘정부24’ 앱을 통한 전자증명서 발급, 제출 대상 증명서를 총 13종으로 확대한다고 밝혔다.주민등록등/초본은 물론 병적증명서, 건강보험자격득실확인서, 건축물대장등·초본, 초중등학교졸업(예정)증명, 예방접종증명 등도 있다. 그럼 어떻게 전자증명서를 발급받고 활용할 수 있는지 자세히 살펴보도록 하자.전자증명서를 발급, 사용하기 위해서는 먼저 ‘전자문서지갑’을 만들어야 한다. 플레이스토어 또는 앱스토어에서 ‘정부24’ 앱을 설치한다.      전자문서지갑 메인화면.(출처=정부24 앱)   로그인 후, 왼쪽 위 메뉴에서 ‘전자문서지갑’을 누르고 지갑이 활성화됐는지 확인하면 된다. 나는 주민등록등/초본을 포함하여 이번부터 서비스된 건강보험 관련 증명서와 병적증명서, 출입국사실증명서, 예방접종증명서를 발급받아보기로 했다. 전자증명서를 처리할 때, ‘공인인증서’는 필수적으로 가지고 있어야 하니 미리 준비하기 바란다.      전자문서지갑으로 발급받은 각종 서류들.(출처=정부24 앱)   ‘전자문서지갑’을 받으면 내 지갑 주소와 내가 받은 증명서, 보낸 내역, 받은 증명서 등을 확인할 수 있다. 받은 증명서는 각종 민원, 금융업무를 처리하는 분들이 주로 활용할 것으로 보인다. 내 지갑 주소는 숫자와 알파벳 형태로 길게 지정된다. 내 지갑 QR코드도 있어 보다 수월하게 업무를 처리할 수 있다.      전자지갑문서에 있는 민원서류 제출을 하기 위해서는 전달받은 지갑 주소를 입력하거나, QR코드를 찍어 보내면 된다.(출처=정부24 앱)   제출은 전달받은 지갑 주소를 ‘복사-붙여넣기’ 하거나 QR코드를 인식해 전송하면 된다. 기관명을 검색하거나 주소를 입력하는 방법도 있다.      각종 기술의 발달과 정부의 노력으로 민원을 처리할 때, 소위 ‘발품을 팔아야 하는’ 수고가 점점 줄어들고 있다.(출처=정부24 누리집)   문재인 정부는 ‘디지털 정부혁신’을 위해 여러 노력을 기울이고 있다. 위의 내용과 같이 국민들이 많이 찾는 종이를 전자문서로 변환하여 자원 낭비와 불필요한 행정력을 줄이는 정책을 착실하게 전개해 나가고 있으며, 대면 업무를 ‘비대면’으로도 가능케 하여 국민들의 ‘가용 가능한 시간’을 점차 늘려주고 있다.정부는 핀테크(fintech, 금융과 기술이 결합한 서비스를 의미) 산업에 초점을 맞춰 스마트폰으로도 바로 결제가 가능한 각종 ‘페이’ 서비스를 육성하고 있다. 비대면으로 모든 금융업무가 처리되는 인터넷 전문은행도 이제 우리 삶 속에 깊숙이 자리잡아 예전에 비해 쉽고 간편한 금융생활을 영위할 수 있게 됐다.       정부24 앱에서 전자증명서 발급 가능한 서비스를 쉽게 확인할 수 있다.(출처=정부24 앱)   참고로, 전자증명서의 보안 문제를 걱정하는 사람들도 있을 것이다. 증명서의 진본은 스마트폰에 저장되는 것이 아니다. 본인만이 접근할 수 있는 클라우드 기반의 저장소에 암호화된 상태로 저장되며 전자지갑에 들어가 비밀번호를 입력하는 등 본인확인 절차를 거쳐야 증명서를 볼 수 있다.그리고 전송받은 전자증명서는 블록체인 보안, 시점확인기술 등 최신 보안기술이 적용돼 위, 변조가 불가능하다고 한다, 정부는 연말까지 국세납세증명 등 전자증명서 발급 대상으로 100종으로 확대해나갈 계획이라고 한다.(출처=행정안전부 보도자료)       정책기자단|전형wjsgud2@naver.com  제 17-19기 민주평화통일자문회의 자문위원 전 형입니다. 외교, 통일, 그리고 박사과정인 한국어교육에 깊은 관심이 있습니다. 유익한 정책이 국민들에게 널리 알려질 수 있도록 최선을 다하겠습니다.	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=298&aid=0000300237

'자산관리의 대중화'를 목표로 인공지능 AI (Artificial Intelligence) 딥러닝 기술로 주요 주가 및 금융 지표 예측, 온라인 투자자문 및 자산관리 서비스를 제공하고 있다. 과거 30년간 금융 및 경제 지표를 스스로 학습해 현재 글로벌 금융시장 상황과 가장 유사한 과거를 찾아내는 딥러닝 알고리즘 '마켓드리머'를 개발해 KB자산운용, KB국민은행, 한화자산운용 등에 공급 중이다. 2018년 2월 Nexon의 NXC와 영국계 Kingsley Ventures로부터 11억원 투자 유치, 5월 중소벤처기업부 프로그램 팁스(TIPS)에 선정됐다. 소비자들이 콰라의 딥러닝 기술이 제공하는 금융 정보를 쉽게 얻을 수 있는 앱 '코쇼(Kosho)'를 지난해 3월 정식 론칭, 약 14만 다운로드를 기록했으며 5월 전문투자자용 종목·뉴스 AI검색 '왓이즈펀드' 베타 출시해 서비스 중이다."'코쇼'와 '왓이즈펀드'는 어떻게 다른가."코쇼는 초보자들도 금융 정보에 최대한 쉽게 접근할 수 있도록 종목별 전망을 퀴즈 형태로 제공하고 금융 정보도 핵심적인 부분만 추려서 제공한다. 왓이즈펀드AI는 금융권 종사자를 비롯해 전문화된 투자 기법을 원하는 일반 투자자들을 위한 금융 키워드 검색 엔진이다. 특정 키워드를 왓이즈펀드 웹사이트 검색 창 안에서 엔터를 치면 키워드와 관련된 주식 종목들이 검색돼 종목별 상세 정보와 뉴스, 공시자료, 미래 예측 수익률과 더불어 종목 비교까지 한눈에 볼 수 있다. 예를 들어 '미세먼지', '금융위기' 등 키워드를 검색하면 해당 키워드와 밀접하게 연결된 주식 종목들이 관련도 순으로 검색된다. 검색한 단어와 연관해 증시 영향력이 높았던 특정 날짜 별 각 종목들의 주가 흐름과 뉴스 자료 등이 함께 검색돼 선택한 종목 간 비교 분석 자료를 볼 수 있다."마케터 전문가인 손 대표가 핀테크에 뛰어든 특별한 이유가 있었다면."콰라의 CEO로서 역점을 둔 가치는 '어려운 금융 정보들을 대중화'다. 사람들이 어렵게 생각하는 금융 분야의 정보를 쉽게 풀어 제공하고 있다. 마케터로서 처음부터 핀테크 산업에 관심을 두고 있던 것은 아니었다. 평범한 직장인으로 외국계 기업에서 브랜드 마케터로 활동 중, 업무 특성상 사람들에게 설명할 일이 많았다. 이 설명을 잘하는 방법이 뭘까 고민을 거듭하면서 결국 어려운 정보를 쉽게 풀어 사람들에게 제공하는 것이 설명을 잘하는 방법이라는 결론을 얻었다. 일반인부터 사업가, 전문가들까지 금융 정보가 필요해도 얻는 방식이 어렵고 해석이 안 되는 금융 정보를 쉽게 풀어낼 방법을 고민하다 사업에 동참했다."자산관리가 돈 있는 사람들의 전유물이란 인식이 있다. 금융이 어려운 여성들이 코쇼를 활용하는 법."이론이 아닌 현실에서 마주하는 금융 파트는 학교에서 가르치지 않은 새로운 내용들이 많은 편이다. 코쇼를 통해서 용어가 익숙해지고 예적금만 하는 것이 아닌 소액으로 다양한 상품군에 투자를 앱에서 배울 수가 있다. 코쇼를 통해서 금융 투자 분야에 대해 익숙해지고 경제와 재테크 전반에 대한 지식과 상식을 늘려가기를 추천드린다."코쇼 이미지. ⓒ콰라소프트콰라는 여성 직원이 약 30%대로 금융업 특성상 보기 드문 여성 비중을 보인다. 여성에게 많은 기회를 제공하는 이유는."조직 전반에 만연한 성 편향은 여성 직원이 리더 역할을 맡는 과정에 중대한 영향을 미친다. 성 편향이 평가 점수에 영향을 미칠 경우, 승진과 관련해 성과 점수에 5퍼센트 영향을 미칠 때 초기 여성 비중이 58퍼센트였던 조직에서 여성 비율이 29퍼센트로 떨어졌다. 그만큼 여성 리더의 역할이 중요하다. 남성이 놓치는 부분을 여성이 발견하고 보완하는 경우가 많다. 여성 대표로서 많은 여성에게 기회를 제공해야 한다고 생각한다. 업계에 첫발을 디뎠을 때 여성으로서 많은 어려움을 겪었다. 핀테크 업계에는 내부 구성원부터 외부 파트너사들까지 많은 남성을 마주하고 있다."[여신 후원자 되기]조혜승 기자 chohs1021@womennews.co.kr▶ 여성신문 후원자가 되주세요▶ 여성신문 '홈페이지'▶ 기사제보, 투고<Copyright ⓒ 여성신문. 무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=310&aid=0000076448

2020.01.06.	헤럴드경제	빅테크 ‘금융독점 경계론’	거대 ICT, 금융부문 급속 진입신용정보 사용 제한 장치 필요구글과 페이스북 같은 거대 정보통신기술(ICT) 기업인 ‘빅테크(BigTech)’들이 금융권으로 영역을 확장하면서 이들의 독점을 우려하는 목소리가 커지고 있다. 빅테크는 금융서비스 제공을 목적으로 디지털 기술을 사용하는 ‘핀테크(FinTech)’와는 규모면에서 차이가 있다. 특히 사업특성상 독점 시장을 구축하는 경향이 뚜렷하다.최근 금융연구원은 ‘빅테크의 금융업 진출현황 및 시사점’이라는 보고서에서 “빅테크는 사업적 특성상 소수에 의한 지배적 플랫폼이 구축되기 쉽고, 그렇게되면 비경쟁적 데이터 및 기술의 사용을 통해 소비자 후생에 악영향을 미칠 수 있다”고 우려했다.실제 검색엔진, 소셜미디어서비스(SNS)로 대표되는 거대 ICT 기업들은 성공을 거둔 일부 기업이 시장을 장악하는 형식의 성장을 취해왔다.보고서는 “빅테크가 제공하는 금융서비스의 큰 규모, 상호연계성으로 인해 (기존 규제로는) 위험이 관리되지 못할 가능성이 있고, 경우에 따라 (일부 서비스는) 금융규제를 아예 적용받지 않기도 한다”고 지적했다.국제 금융 모니터링 기구인 금융안정위원회(FSB)도 이미 지난해 초 빅테크 출현과 그 파급을 우려하는 취지의 보고서를 냈다.빅테크는 최근 빠르게 금융 부문에서 덩치를 키우는 모습이다. 소셜미디어서비스 기업은 이용자 간 간편송금 서비스를 제공하고, 이들의 연결구조에 관한 정보를 수집한다. 이를 이용하면 보험상품 등의 마케팅과 가격책정에 사용할 수 있다. 검색 서비스 분야에서는 검색결과 정보를 전자상거래 영역으로 확대하면서 금융소비자와의 접점을 넓히는 추세다.보고서는 이에 “소비자 정보, 신용정보 등에 대한 권한과 의무를 명확하게 하고 독점적 지배력을 제한할 수 있는 장치, 기존 금융사업자 및 빅테크 간 규제차익을 최소화하는 방안이 마련돼야 한다”고 했다. 또 “범국경 금융서비스가 확대되고 있으므로 국제적인 협력과 규칙이 마련될 필요가 있다”고 했다.홍태화 기자▶네이버에서 헤럴드경제 채널 구독하기 ▶헤럴드경제 사이트 바로가기 - Copyrights ⓒ 헤럴드경제 & heraldbiz.com, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지 -	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=016&aid=0001621099
2020.01.14.	디지털데일리	블로코, ‘가상자산 및 디지털 화폐 동향 보고서’ 발표	[디지털데일리 이상일기자] 블록체인 기술 전문 기업인 블로코(대표 김원범)는 디지털 화폐 정의와 산업의 주요 이슈를 살펴보고 주요 동향을 소개하는 ‘가상자산(Cryptocurrency) 그리고 디지털 화폐 동향 보고서’를 발표했다. 국제통화기금은 2019년 7월 발간된 핀테크 노트(FINTECH Notes)에서 ▲유형(type) ▲정산 가치(value) ▲지급 보증 ▲기술이라는 네 가지 기준으로 디지털 화폐를 구분했다. 첫 번째 디지털 화폐 구분 기준인 유형은 크게 청구권 중심(Claim-based)과 개체 중심(Object-based)로 나뉜다. 청구권 중심 지급은 이용자들이 중앙은행에 계좌를 개설하여 디지털화폐를 사용하게 되고, 금융기관은 해당 계좌를 통해 이용자 별 보유 및 거래 내역을 기록하고 관리한다. 두 번째 기준인 정산 가치는 청구권이 행사됨에 따라 발생되는 화폐와의 교환비가 고정인지 가변인지에 따라 구분된다. 또한, 지급 보증은 정부 혹은 민간 발행 주체에 의존하는지로 나눌 수 있다.마지막 기준인 기술은 정산 과정이 중앙화된 서버 혹은 분산 원장 기술(Distributed Ledger Technology, DLT) 혹은 블록체인 기술을 활용해 분산 처리되는지를 구분한다. 분산 처리에는 노드 운영 및 네트워크 참여가 제한적인 프라이빗 구조나 누구나 참여할 수 있는 퍼블릭 구조가 모두 포함된다.블로코 리포트에 따르면, 국제통화기금(IMF)은 화폐 혹은 지불 수단을 이러한 기준에 따라, ▲현재 논의 중인 ‘중앙은행 화폐(Central bank money)’, ▲각각의 계산 단위를 지니며, 비은행 기관 혹은 기업이 블록체인을 기반으로 발행하는 ‘가상자산(Cryptocurrency)’, ▲가장 널리 쓰이고 있는 청구권 중심 화폐로 정부가 지급을 보증하고, 은행 계좌를 기반으로 운영하는 ‘은행 보증 화폐(B-money)’, ▲액면가에 대한 지급 보증을 지원하는 ‘민간 보증 화폐(E-money)’, ▲민간 보증 화폐와 유사하지만, 청구권 행사 시 고정 비율 대신 가변 비율이 적용되는 ‘단기 투자 화폐(I-Money)’ 등의 다섯 가지로 나눌 수 있다.  블로코 김원범 대표는 “올해에는 각 국가 중앙은행들이 CBDC 연구에서 더 나아가 발행 검토, 시범 운영 등이 진행될 것으로 예상된다. 디지털 화폐 대중화를 위한 거래 투명성과 안전성, 환금성 등을 보증할 수 있도록 블록체인 기술의 진화도 이어질 것으로 기대된다”라고 전망했다.<이상일 기자>2401@ddaily.co.kr뉴스채널 설정 - 네이버 메인에서 디지털데일리 뉴스를 볼 수 있어요.IT정보의 즐거운 업그레이드[딜라이트닷넷]<저작권자 © 디지털데일리 무단전재-재배포금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=105&oid=138&aid=0002081590
2020.05.27.	매경닷컴	Kakao, Samsung Fire & Marine ditch plan to form joint digital insurer	Kakao Corp. has severed its digital insurance partnership with South Korea’s largest non-life insurer Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance Co. after failing to reconcile business differences. The two companies on Tuesday informed the Financial Services Commission (FSC) they have cancelled plans to form a joint online insurance company. The two entered into an alliance last September and have been readying to file a preliminary application with the FSC. Under the initial agreement, Kakao Pay, Kakao’s online payment service unit, was to hold the management rights, with Kakao and Samsung Fire & Marine as strategic investors. Kakao Pay was to own 50 percent of the joint venture. Kakao would have 30 percent and Samsung Fire & Marine 20 percent. The companies appear to have parted on friendly terms, signing an agreement to a general partnership on Monday. Kakao, operator of Korea’s largest messenger platform, has been trying to add insurance to its rapidly expanding fintech portfolio. Kakao Pay is reportedly seeking to set up a digital insurer on its own rather than searching for another partner. Insiders say it is aiming to finish preparations by the end of this year.The collaboration fell apart largely due to a conflict over the launch of digital car insurance, according to sources. Samsung Fire & Marine reportedly wanted to delay the offering, fearing cannibalization with its own online auto insurance service. It was also wary of the grim business prospects given the reduced auto use amid the pandemic. Kakao, however, saw the auto insurance plan as a key marketing point for the new insurer. One big influence appears to have been Carrot General Insurance, which grabbed attention in March with its new pay-per-mile auto insurance plan. Kakao has been closely following Carrot as it is Korea’s first online-only insurance company, launched by Hanwha General Insurance Co., SK Telecom Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. last October.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=009&aid=0004583271
2020.02.26.	edaily	[톡톡!금융]'제2의 토스' 뱅크샐러드에 은행들 잇단 러브콜	- 여러 금융기관 자산 한눈에 보여주고- ''대출상품 비교추천 서비스'' 매력- 우리·KB국민·NH농협은행 등 업무제휴[이데일리 김범준 기자] ‘제2의 토스(toss)’로 불리는 뱅크샐러드가 최근 은행들의 잇따른 러브콜을 받고 있다. 뱅크샐러드는 국내 핀테크(Fintech) 기업 레이니스트가 ‘간편한 내 돈 관리’를 표방하며 출시한 개인 자산관리서비스 플랫폼이다. 2018년부터 토스를 운영하는 비바리퍼블리카와 함께 통합조회 서비스를 선도했다. ‘스크래핑(데이터 추출)’ 기술을 적용해 여러 금융기관에 흩어진 금융 및 실물 자산을 모두 연결해 한눈에 보여주는 기능이 핵심이다. 전월 이용실적 등 자산관리 뿐 아니라 예·적금 및 카드상품, 연금저축, 대출 및 투자 등 알고리즘으로 설계된 맞춤 금융 서비스도 이뤄진다. 뱅크샐러드 앱은 현재 구글 앱스토어에서 다운로드 100만건 이상을 기록하고 있다.NH농협은행은 지난 17일 뱅크샐러드와 데이터 기반 금융 상품·서비스 구축을 위한 업무 협약을 체결했다. 이날 협약식에는 이대훈 농협은행장이 직접 참여할 만큼 내부에서 큰 관심을 받고 있다. 농협은행은 NH스마트뱅킹 앱에서 오픈뱅킹 서비스를 강화하고 있다.Sh수협은행도 이달 올해 첫 ‘아침을 여는 강연’으로 김태훈 레이니스트(뱅크샐러드) 대표를 초청해 ‘마이데이터(My Data)로 만드는 금융의 새 지평’이라는 주제로 특강을 진행하고 금융 경험의 디지털화 방안을 모색했다. 이날 특강은 임직원들의 질문이 쇄도하는 등 반응이 뜨거웠다는 후문이다. 수협은행 역시 최근 오픈뱅킹을 출시하고 다양한 핀테크 업체와 제휴를 늘려가고 있다.김태훈 레이니스트(뱅크샐러드) 대표가 지난 13일 서울 송파구 Sh수협은행 본사에서 이동빈 은행장 및 임직원을 대상으로 ‘아침을 여는 강연’ 특강을 진행하고 있다.(사진=Sh수협은행 제공)앞서 우리은행과 KB국민은행도 뱅크샐러드와 직접 손을 잡았다. 지난해 말 오픈뱅킹 출범이 계기가 되면서다.우리은행은 지난해 9월 금융위원회 혁신금융서비스로 지정된 뱅크샐러드의 ‘대출상품 비교추천 서비스’에 시중은행 최초로 참여했다. 공동 개발한 오픈 응용프로그램 인터페이스(API)를 통해 뱅크샐러드 앱에서 ‘우리비상금대출’ 등 대출상품의 개인별 한도·금리를 직접 조회하고 우리은행 위비뱅크 앱과 연동해 대출을 약정할 수 있다. 지난 연말 ‘우리♡뱅샐했어요’라는 독특한 명칭의 이벤트 진행에 이어, 뱅크샐러드와 제휴한 새로운 신용대출 서비스 이벤트도 조만간 실시할 예정이다.국민은행은 지난해 말 뱅크샐러드와 ‘협업 기반 비즈니스 추진의 동력 확보를 위한 전략적 업무 제휴’를 맺었다. 이번 협약을 통해 양사는 △데이터 분석을 통한 비즈니스 고도화 △고객 상담 및 상품 판매채널 연계 △공동 마케팅 협력 및 노하우 공유 등에서 협력할 예정이다. 또 공동 업무그룹을 구성하고 각사의 데이터를 활용해 상품을 추천하는 알고리즘을 개발하기로 했다.금융권 관계자는 “최근 오픈뱅킹의 시행과 곧 이어 마이데이터 시대가 도래하면 결국 선택 받는 하나의 앱만 살아남는 구조가 될 것”이라며 “은행들은 주도권 싸움을 위해 뱅크샐러드·토스 등 혁신금융의 성공 사례가 되고 있는 핀테크들과의 상생을 모색 중”이라고 말했다.김범준 (yolo@edaily.co.kr)＜ⓒ종합 경제정보 미디어 이데일리 - 무단전재 & 재배포 금지＞	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=018&aid=0004583669
2020.03.18.	코리아헤럴드	Viva Republica inches closer to launching brokerage service	Fintech platform operator Viva Republica said Wednesday that it has received preliminary approval to run a stock trading business from the nation’s financial watchdog, the Financial Services Commission.In order to run the stock business in a safe and stable manner, the company, which runs peer-to-peer money transfer app Toss, will beef up workforce and upgrade systems in the coming months before receiving final approval from the financial authority, the Seoul-based financial technology firm said.“The number of individual investors has remained at 5 million, or 13 percent of the entire population, and those in their 20s and 30s account for only 25 percent, lower than those in advanced financial markets around the world, including the US,” said Park Jae-min, chief of a Viva Republica affiliate to launch the stock trading house.Of 16 million Toss subscribers, 60 percent of them are those in their 20s and 30s. Viva Republica also received a preliminary nod of approval to run an online only bank in December.By Kim Young-won (wone0102@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드 유튜브 바로가기]▶ 페이스북   ▶ 트위터 바로가기<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000216539
2020.03.05.	코리아헤럴드	Parliament turns down revision proposal for online-only banks	Unexpected rejection likely to further undermine money-losing K bank’s businesses　K bank‘s head office in Gwanghwamun in Seoul. (K bank)The National Assembly on Thursday rejected a proposed bill to ease regulations for online-only banks, which will deal a heavy blow to K bank, one of South Korea’s two online banks that is struggling to raise additional funds due to regulatory hurdles.The bill was unexpectedly voted down 82:75 with 27 abstaining at the plenary session, although it received the green light from the legislation and judiciary committee a day before, raising anticipation it would boost the fintech industry. The decision came after liberal lawmakers’ last-minute push to block the passage of the bill at the plenary meeting held late afternoon.“Banks should be the most reliable corporate entities as they do business with money from the public,” said Chae Yi-bae, a lawmaker from Bareunmirae Party. “Those who are likely to commit a fraud on the public do not deserve to be owners of banks.”Initially intended to regulate traditional banking companies, the existing rule bans information and communications technology companies from gaining majority shares in a financial firm after they have violated antitrust laws in the past five years. It has been considered by some critics as outdated for today’s banking business environment, which has seen the emergence of online banks with no physical branches. The planned revision of the bill was aimed at easing the tough regulations for the ownership of online-only banks. Telecom firm KT has tried to raise its stake in K bank after a new regulatory change in January last year that allows nonfinancial companies to own up to 34 percent of an internet-only bank. Its attempt to increase its stake from the current 10 percent to 34 percent by investing approximately 590 billion won ($497.7 million) has so far been futile, as the mobile carrier has been accused of having participating in price-rigging schemes.Since March last year, the Financial Services Commission has postponed a review of KT’s application to become the largest shareholder of the bank, citing the allegation. “KT will discuss with other shareholders to find ways to raise funds needed for the online bank,” a spokesperson of the telecom firm said.K bank stopped money lending services in April last year due to a shortage of funds with its Bank for International Settlements capital adequacy ratio hitting a low of 11.85 percent as of September last year, the lowest among local banking companies at the time.By Kim Young-won (wone0102@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000216172

2020.02.06.	코리아헤럴드	Insurance sector speeds up digital transition	Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance’s headquarters in Seocho, Seoul. (Yonhap)Traditional insurance companies in South Korea are speeding up digital transformation of their operations and services to compete with emerging tech-savvy companies that are proliferating in the financial sector. However, their digital strategy also involves industrial crossover partnerships with the emerging competitors, if necessary. Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance, the nation’s largest non-life insurance firm, and Kakao Pay, a fintech spin-off of mobile messenger giant Kakao, together plan to set up an online only insurance company this year. The two companies are expected to file an application for a preliminary license with the financial authorities next month. The regulator Financial Services Commission will decide on granting a license to what will become the nation’s second online non-life insurance firm within two months after receiving the application. The insurance firm will have to apply for the final authorization within six months after getting the preliminary license.Kakao Pay is expected to help combine its cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence and blockchain, with products developed by the insurance unit of Samsung Group.“Conventional insurance firms will have to offer more values than just financial products to keep up with the fast-changing business environment,” an official from Kakao Pay was quoted as saying by news outlet Korea Economic Daily. The joint company is expected to start operating as early as the first half of next year after completing the license process.Joining forces with SK Telecom and Hyundai Motor Group, Hanwha General Insurance launched the nation’s online non-life insurance firm Carrot General Insurance in January. The company has launched new types of insurance products in Korea, including a pay-per-mile insurance product which charges drivers a premium based on driving distance, and an insurance service for pets.To help accelerate the pace of digital transformation, the financial authorities, including the FSC and the Financial Supervisory Service, have also rolled up their sleeves. Working with members of the General Insurance Association of Korea that represents the domestic non-life insurance firms, the financial authorities will together establish an organization to promote the insure-tech segment this year. The new organization will allow the authorities and private companies to better communicate with each other in their efforts to break down regulatory hurdles for digital transition initiatives.By Kim Young-won (wone0102@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000215375
2020.03.16.	헤럴드경제	M&A·스타트업 투자…해외 금투업계도 핀테크 선점 경쟁	美 찰스슈와브, 인수·합병으로 역량 ↑온라인 수수료 폐지·채권 서비스 확대모건스탠리, 이트레이드 인수 소매 강화골드만삭스·JP모건 등은 스타트업 투자中앤트파이낸셜, MMF ‘위어바오’ 운영카카오페이증권에 이어 토스증권 설립까지 가시화하면서 국내 금융투자업계에 핀테크(FinTech=Finance+Technology) 바람이 거세다. 이런 가운데, 미국·중국·일본 등 해외 금융투자사들도 디지털 혁신을 위해 경쟁적으로 핀테크 분야를 강화하고 있다.미국 최대 온라인 증권사 찰스슈와브(Charles Schwab)는 지난해 9월부터 기존 건당 4.95달러에 달했던 온라인 주식, 상장주식펀드(ETF), 옵션 거래수수료를 전면 폐지해 이트레이드(E Trade), TD아메리트레이드(TD Ameritrade) 등 경쟁사들의 동참을 이끌었다. 찰스슈와브의 수수료 폐지에는 여러 배경이 있었지만 특히 실리콘밸리의 스타트업 로빈후드의 무료 주식거래 서비스가 인기를 끈 것이 결정적 요인으로 알려져 있다.포브스에 따르면 피터 크로포드 찰스슈와브 최고재무책임자(CFO)는 “로빈후드와 같은 핀테크 기업들이 당장의 큰 위협은 아닐 수 있으나, 신규 진입자에 대해 너무 늦게 대응함으로써 문제가 되는 경우는 이미 여러 산업에서 무수히 많이 봐왔다. 무료 수수료는 불가피한 추세며 우리도 기다릴 이유가 없다”고 설명했다.찰스슈와브는 인수·합병(M&A)을 통해 핀테크 역량을 강화하고 있다. 지난해 미국 2위 온라인 증권사인 TD아메리트레이드 인수를 발표한 데 이어 자산운용사 와스머슈뢰더를 인수한다고 지난달 밝혔다. 이로써 온라인 거래 서비스 영역을 주식에서 채권 분야로 확대할 전망이다. 글로벌 투자은행(IB) 모건스탠리는 온라인 증권사 이트레이드를 인수해 소비자 직접 서비스를 강화할 방침이다.골드만삭스, JP모건 등 대형 IB들은 핀테크 스타트업 투자를 통해 시너지 효과를 노리고 있다. 스타트업과 손잡고 자산관리, 매매체결 위험관리, 데이터 분석, 소매대출, 기업솔루션 등에 핀테크를 적용하는 것이다. 골드만삭스는 핵심사업 모델을 전통적인 IB 업무에서 플랫폼 비즈니스로 바꾼다는 계획 아래 모티프, 심포니, 데이터마이너, 아카디아, 마르케타 등의 스타트업에 투자하고 있다.자본시장연구원에 따르면 JP모건은 모티프, 심포니, 플레이드, 클라우드나인, 오픈핀 등에, 모건스탠리는 심포니, 에리스, 데이터마이너, 아카디아, 루닷컴 등에 투자 중이다. 노무라는 2017년 혁신신사업 자회사인 엔빌리지(N-Village)를 설립했으며 지난해 미국 스마트 컨트랙트 감사 회사인 퀀트스탬프에 투자했다.중국 알리바바그룹은 핀테크를 넘어 정보기술(IT) 기업의 주도로 새로운 금융서비스를 제공하는 ‘테크핀(TechFin)’을 꾀하고 있다. 알리바바의 자회사 앤트파이낸셜은 톈홍자산운용과 손잡고 머니마켓펀드(MMF) ‘위어바오’를 서비스하고 있다. 앤트파이낸셜은 2017년 국내 기업 카카오페이에 약 2300억원을 투자해 주목을 끌기도 했다. 김현경 기자▶헤럴드 ‘팩트체커’ 진실은 바로 이것▶코로나19 현황보기 ▶선별진료소 확인 - Copyrights ⓒ 헤럴드경제 & heraldbiz.com, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지 -	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=016&aid=0001648899

IT의 성격을 가진 전자금융업은 투자가 가능하도록 바뀐 것이다. 당시 상해사무소에 있던 강문수 이사는 토스에 투자하기 위해 한국으로 돌아와 그해 바로 시리즈A 라운드에 투자했다. 이 투자는 유일하게 국내 벤처캐피탈(VC)이 토스에 투자한 사례로 남았다. 유니콘기업(기업가치 10억달러 이상 비상장 스타트업)인 비바리퍼블리카의 ‘토스’와 우아한 형제들의 ‘배달의 민족’, 그리고 예비 유니콘기업인 ‘스타일쉐어’ 등에 잇따라 투자한 스타 심사역 강문수 이사가 쿼드벤처스(QUAD Ventures)에 둥지를 틀었다. [사진=이데일리 노진환 기자] 강문수 쿼드벤처스 이사◇ ‘토스’를 알아본 국내 유일 심사역 강문수 쿼드벤처스 이사가 토스에 투자를 집행한 2015년만 해도 토스가 인터넷은행과 증권사까지 넘보는 회사로 성장하리라 예상하는 이는 많지 않았다. 강문수 이사는 “이승건 비바리퍼블리카 대표의 사업 계획을 듣는데 다 해낼 것 같다는 느낌을 받았다”며 “아무리 사람이 좋아도 이 같은 느낌을 받는 경우가 드물다. 한 마디로 꽂혔었다”고 말했다.논란도 있었다. 당시 토스는 금융기관과 제휴도 일부만 돼 있었을 뿐이었고, 제대로 된 비즈니스 모델이 없는 상황이었다. 국내 대부분의 기관투자가들은 투자에 회의적이었다. 하지만 강 이사의 생각은 달랐다. 그는 “당시 토스라는 서비스에 대해 추정할 수 있는 게 아무것도 없었다”며 “투자심의위원회(투심위)에서도 반대가 있었지만 결국 외국처럼 한국에서도 토스와 같은 서비스가 나올 수밖에 없다는 데에 당시 회사(KTB네트워크)도 동의를 해줬다”고 밝혔다. 강 이사가 투자한 시리즈A 단계 토스의 기업가치는 250억원이다. 지금 토스는 2조7000억원을 공식적으로 인정 받았다. 미국의 알토스벤처스와 퀄컴벤처스, 굿워터캐피탈, 싱가포르투자청 등이 토스에 함께 투자했다. 배달의 민족을 운영하는 ‘우아한 형제들’과 예비 유니콘으로 꼽히는 ‘스타일쉐어’도 강 이사의 주요 트랙레코드다. 이 밖에도 푸드플라이, 알비더블유(RBW), 원티드랩 등에 잇따라 투자했다. 2010년 VC업계에 발을 디딘 이후 지금까지 총 국내외 스타트업 36곳에 총 1059억원의 투자를 집행했다. ◇ 올해 하드웨어·프롭테크 등 주목…“트렌드 발맞출 것”강 이사의 트랙레코드는 주로 IT서비스와 소비재, 콘텐츠 투자에 강점을 보여왔다. 심사역으로 경력을 시작한 지난 2010년 이후에 스마트폰이 등장했고 본격적으로 관련 서비스가 등장한 영향이다. 그는 “삶의 중요한 변화를 주도하는 플랫폼 비즈니스에 흥미를 많이 느꼈다”며 “그 과정에서 B2C(기업과 소비자간 거래) 서비스 중 고성장하는 경우가 많이 나왔다”고 말했다. 최근에 그가 주목하는 업종은 소재와 부품 등의 하드웨어와 B2B(기업과 기업간 거래) 서비스형 소프트웨어(SaaS)다. 그동안 성장세가 더디면서 VC들의 선택을 받지 못한 곳들이다. 강 이사는 “2차전지나 폴더블폰 관련 소재 부품, 구독모델 기반의 B2B SaaS가 올해를 분기점으로 빛을 볼 것으로 예상된다”고 말했다. 그는 또 “프롭테크와 모빌리티 분야에도 관심이 많다”며 “도시가 스마트시티로 가는 과정에서 결국은 모빌리티와 부동산에서 혁신이 나타날 것으로 예상하고 트렌드에 맞춰 찾아보고 있다”고 밝혔다. [사진=이데일리 노진환 기자] (오른쪽부터) 조강헌 쿼드벤처스 대표, 강문수 이사, 김지범 팀장◇ 블라인드 펀드 설정 목표…“유연한 투자 할 것”강 이사는 지난 10일부터 쿼드벤처스에 출근해 쿼드자산운용과 알바트로스인베스트먼트 등을 거친 조강헌 대표와 쿼드운용, 한화증권 등을 거친 김지범 팀장과 함께 합을 맞추고 있다. 그는 쿼드벤처스에서 보다 자유롭고 유연한 판단으로 투자를 집행할 계획이다. 강 이사는 “그동안 회사나 펀드운용 전략이 우선시 되면서 특정 산업을 깊게 보지 못한 아쉬움 등이 있었다”며 “온전한 제 시각으로 새로운 도전을 하기 위해 쿼드벤처스로 옮겼다”고 밝혔다. 올해는 블라인드(blind)펀드를 설정하는 것이 쿼드벤처스의 단기 목표다. 장기적으로는 모회사인 쿼드자산운용과 함께 스타트업에 투자하는 상품도 만들 계획이다. 쿼드벤처스는 쿼드자산운용이 지난해 7월 조직 일부를 분리해 설립한 신생 VC다. 작년 8월 엔켐과 에이프로 등 2차전지 소재, 제조기업에 투자하는 ‘쿼드1호벤처투자조합’ 10월에는 공유오피스인 패스트파이브에 투자하는 ‘쿼드2호벤처투자조합’을 각각 설정했다.이광수 (gs88@edaily.co.kr)네이버 홈에서 ‘이데일리’ 뉴스 [구독하기▶] , 청춘뉘우스~ [스냅타임▶]이데일리 기자들의 비밀공간 [기자뉴스룸▶]＜ⓒ종합 경제정보 미디어 이데일리 - 무단전재 & 재배포 금지＞	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=018&aid=0004577616
2020.01.23.	코리아헤럴드	FSS expands consumer protection in reshuffle	The Financial Supervisory Service Gov. Yoon Suk-heun speaks Thursday in a press briefing on the organization's reshuffle plan. (Yonhap)The Financial Supervisory Service on Thursday unveiled its reshuffle blueprint, focusing on consumer protection and innovative finance.The move came amid the ongoing controversy regarding the so-called derivatives-linked fund fiasco -- the improper sales of products by local banks and securities. The FSS is slated to announce its sanction decision for two major banking chiefs later this month.“To respond to the stronger consumer protection needs and enhance the supervisory functions over high-risk financial products, the FSS has come up with a reorganization plan,” the watchdog said in a release.The key pillars of the reshuffle are to expand the department in charge of financial consumer protection and to establish a new sector to support the digital transformation of financial supervision, officials said.The financial consumer protection department, previously aligned in six divisions and 26 teams, will be rearranged into 13 divisions and 40 teams.While seven divisions will focus on preemptive damage prevention, the other six will take charge of disputes, petitions and related investigations.With this subdivision of functions, a deputy governor post has been added, bringing the total number of the senior level posts to nine.Meanwhile, the FSS’ sanctions committee is slated to hold its final meeting on Jan. 31 to decide the penalties for KEB Hana Bank and Woori Bank, as well as their respective chiefs at the time of the disputed DLF sales last year.The panel earlier delivered a notice to Hana Financial Group Chairman Ham Young-joo and Woori Financial Group Chairman Sohn Tae-seung that they may be handed down “reprimands and warnings” for failing to supervise the internal process.Other newly established teams in the FSS’ latest reshuffle plan included a “SubTech Innovation” team, in charge of technology-based financial supervisory system, and a “RegTech” team under the IT-Fintech Strategy Department to supervise the IT sectors of financial companies.In step with the incumbent Moon Jae-in government’s New Southern Policy and also to seek new growth opportunities, the FSS will also initiate a special task force on helping local financial firms expand business in Southeast Asian countries.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000215088
2020.01.12.	매일신문	[금융]규제 묶여있던 '핀테크', 2020년 날아오를수 있을까	CES2020에서도 핵심 토픽 중 하나컨설팅 기업인 맥킨지는 최근 보고서를 통해 "세계 은행의 3분의 1은 획기적으로 혁신하지 못하면 머지않아 소멸될 것"이라고 경고했다.금융에 기술을 입힌 '핀테크'는 금융업계 전반에 최대 위기이자 기회 요인으로 주목받고 있다. 기존에는 금융기업들이 정보기술(IT)기술을 도입하는 수준이었지만, 이젠 기술력 뛰어난 IT 기업이 금융을 접목하는 사례도 들면서 이대로면 '핀테크' 대신 '테크핀'이 대세를 주도날 날도 머지 않았다는 것이 금융계의 공통된 전망이다.◆CES도 주목하는 핀테크 세계세계 최대 가전·정보기술(IT) 전시회 'CES(Consumer Electronics Show) 2020'가 열린 9일(현지시간) 미국 네바다주 라스베이거스 컨벤션홀 앞이 사람들로 붐비고 있다. 연합뉴스새해 벽두부터 열린 미국 라스베이거스 CES2020에 우리나라 시중은행 관계자들이 대거 달려갔다. 핀테크가 금융의 판을 흔들고 있들고 있기 때문이다.지난 7일 미국 라스베이거스에서 개막한 세계 최대 전자쇼 'CES 2020'의 주요 토픽 중 하나도 핀테크였다. 라스베이거스 컨벤션센터와 샌즈엑스포홀 등에 전시부스를 차린 핀테크 업체만 124곳에 달했다. 지구촌 기술 트렌드의 최전선인 CES는 작년부터는 핀테크를 공식 토론 주제로 잡아 올해도 핀테크 투자법, 블록체인 규제, 가상화폐 등 다양한 주제의 콘퍼런스를 개최했다.윤종규 KB금융그룹 회장도 올해 첫 출장지로 CES를 선택했다. 국내 금융지주 회장 가운데 CES를 직접 찾은 것은 윤 회장이 처음이다. 국민은행 관계자는 "이제 디지털을 모르면 금융업을 할 수 없는 시대가 됐다"고 말했다.◆초라한 한국의 핀테크 성적표이미지 출처=클립아트코리아금융사와 핀테크 업체 간 연합전선 구축은 세계적인 현상이다. 테크동향조사기관인 CB인사이트에 따르면 글로벌 핀테크 투자 규모는 2013년 이후 연평균 67% 증가했다. 벤처캐피털에 이어 전통 금융회사와 IT 기업까지 핀테크 투자에 뛰어들면서 판이 커졌다.하지만 한국의 핀테크 성적표는 초라하다. 글로벌 컨설팅업체 언스트앤영이 평가한 핀테크 도입지수에 따르면 한국은 공동 1위인 중국 인도는 물론 남아프리카공화국(3위), 페루(6위) 등에도 밀리며 13위에 그쳤다. 중국 후룬연구소가 발표한 기업가치 1조원 이상인 핀테크 기업 중 한국 업체는 토스가 유일한 데 비해 중국은 22곳, 미국은 21곳이었다.엽계는 이를 금융업에 대한 규제가 과도하기 때문으로 풀이하고 있다. 사실 카카오뱅크, 케이뱅크 등 국내 인터넷은행도 각종 규제에 발목이 잡혀 증자 등에 어려움을 겪고 있다. 특히 자금부족에 시달려온 케이 뱅크는 이번 국회에서 인터넷은행특례법 개정안에 희망을 걸었으나, 법안 통과가 무산되면서 개점휴업 상태가 길어질 전망이다.◆올해 도약 기반 마련할수 있을까그나마 다행인 것은 지난 9일 국회에서 데이터 3법이 통과됐다는 점이다. 개인정보보호법·정보통신망법·신용정보법 개정안 등 법안이 통과되면서 핀테크의 '혈액'이라 불리는 빅데이터 정보 활용의 폭이 넓어진 것이다.금융위원회(금융위)도 올해 '투자와 개방' 전략을 통해 핀테크 판을 키우겠다는 방침이다. ▷오픈뱅킹 전면 도입 ▷금융 빅데이터 활용범위 확대 ▷은행권 자산통합조회 ▷금융거래정보 제공내역 모바일 확인 ▷크라우드펀딩 허용기업 범위 확대 등 전통적인 금융 서비스가 다뤘던 영역을 개방해 다양한 핀테크 서비스가 등장할 수 있는 기반을 마련했다.또 핀테크 서비스 중 P2P(개인대 개인) 금융이 제도권 안으로 들어온다. 온라인투자연계금융업법 시행을 통해 영업행위 규제, 소비자 보호 및 감독·검사·제재권 등 법적 기반이 마련됐다.전자금융업자에 대해서도 후불결제를 허용하는 방안도 올 하반기 중 시행된다. 이를 통해 카카오페이·네이버페이 등 간편결제 시스템은 기존 선충전 후결제 방식에서 벗어나 신용카드처럼 사용할 수 있게 된다.대구은행 관계자는 "데이터 3법 통과로 금융 데이터와 비금융 데이터를 결합해 신용정보를 보다 세분화한 서비스를 제공하고, 보험업계는 건강관리와 데이터를 연계한 새로운 상품 개발에 나서는 등 경쟁이 가속화 할 것으로 보인다"고 전망했다.※핀테크(FinTech)=금융(Finance)과 기술(Technology)의 합성어. 금융과 IT의 융합을 통한 금융서비스 및 산업의 변화를 통칭한다. 모바일, SNS, 빅데이터 등 새로운 IT기술 등을 활용한 저렴한 수수료와 간편성·편의성이 특징이다. 모바일뱅킹과 앱카드, 각종페이 서비스 등 다양한 금융서비스를 제공한다.한윤조 기자 hanyunjo@imaeil.com▶ 네이버에서 매일신문 구독하기▶ 매일신문 네이버TV 바로가기▶ 매일신문 Youtube 바로가기ⓒ매일신문 - www.imaeil.com	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=088&aid=0000628321
2020.03.03.	코리아헤럴드	[Feature] Amid market transition, Korea’s bank unions want bigger role, power	Spurred by IBK case, unions seek representation on board, more leverageIBK workers obstruct new CEO Yoon Jong-won from entering the bank’s headquarters in Seoul on Jan. 7. (Yonhap)　The new chief executive officer of state-run Industrial Bank of Korea was unable to enter his office for nearly a month, and there was an obvious reason. Facing agitating unionized workers in January, IBK CEO Yoon Jong-won turned back, without a word, and headed home every morning.But the doors opened at the end of the month, after Yoon agreed to three key concessions, including the provision that labor would be allowed to recommend a board member.The 27-day protest, when workers blocked the path of a CEO appointed by President Moon Jae-in, was a strong stand against excessive government meddling in the organization’s personnel affairs, the union said. Yet the protest -- and the growing power of unionized workers in the banking sector -- drew a mixed response as bankers are widely seen as elites, not blue-collar workers. Like the IBK, other labor unions of major lenders -- KB Kookmin, Hana, Woori and Shinhan -- are all members of Korean Financial Industry Union, an umbrella organization with a membership of 37 labor units associated with private and public financial institutions and around 100,000 employees in the industry. Its mission has remained the same for decades, since its establishment in 1960: to elevate the workers’ status in the industry. But today it appears to be facing a bigger threat: the diminishing role of rank-and-file bankers in the era of digitalization of the capital market. “In the financial sector, the foray of fintech firms and change in the processing and transaction system has changed the role of employees,” said Lee Jeong-hee, a research fellow at the state-run Korea Labor Institute. “It is crucial for employers not to force adaption of new technology on their employees, but to allow time for adjustment and perhaps negotiate new labor hours suitable under the current circumstances,” she added. Given the changing market circumstances, the KFIU is taking a new approach, with a new goal of implementing a 35-hour workweek at commercial banks and expanding workers’ participation in management through governance reform. Behind the move is the KFIU’s new head Park Hong-bae, who is also chief of KB Kookmin Bank’s labor union and is considered a hard-liner.“Our common goal always has been to elevate the status of workers in the financial sector through wage and welfare negotiations,” said Park.Into the boardroom As seen in IBK’s case, the issue of worker representation on corporate boards appears to be gaining strength among banking unions. Yoon’s promise to allow workers to “recommend” a board member is seen as a precursor to actual employee representation on corporate boards, since the current agreement does not guarantee voting rights to the unionists. Nevertheless, it has become a thorny issue for many. KB Kookmin Bank`s labor union members hold protest signs at an event held ahead of a full-scale strike in January 2019. (Yonhap)KB Financial Group’s union was the first to depart from the starting line, bolstered by President Moon’s campaign pledge to adopt a corporate structure where workers have greater representation. The banking group was the first to list worker representation as an agenda item at two shareholders meetings -- first in November 2017 and again in March 2018 -- but the idea was voted down. It drew strong opposition from foreign shareholders, who held a combined 70 percent stake in the holding group. The state-run Export-Import Bank of Korea then recommended a candidate for an external board position in January, but the Ministry of Economy and Finance refused. The ministry has the final authority over the selection of board members. But some industry watchers believe IBK may eventually be the first in the industry to adopt the new model due to its nature as a state-run lender. Its external board members are confirmed by the policymaking Financial Supervisory Service, not by shareholders. “Korean businesses lack intra-company powers that can question employers’ dogmatic decisions,” said Lee Tae-yong, director of the IBK’s labor union.“The US industries are largely based on shareholder capitalism, while Europe is focused on stakeholder management and related officials. That gives ground for the involvement of labor representatives on corporate boards. Korea has yet to establish a system such as either (the US or Europe),” he added. FSC Chairman Eun Sung-soo is taking a cautious approach to the matter, telling reporters in January that the practice “will not be immediately adopted” but he would carefully consider it “in time.”Eun’s attitude, though not affirmative, is a noticeable shift from his predecessor’s approach toward the issue. The agency’s previous chairman, Choi Jong-ku, had firmly denied the unionists’ request, saying that “compared with other sectors, the financial sector is neither poor or financially disadvantaged enough to adopt worker representation on the board.”Some say fighting for worker representation in boardrooms would be “unthinkable” in other industries, which are dominated by family-run conglomerates. Labor protests in chaebol have been aggressive as they often target the owner family and its weaknesses to gain leverage in negotiations. Korea’s banks, by nature, have no ties to chaebol, meaning there is no line of succession for leadership roles and the chiefs are in power for a limited time, depending on cooperation from the union, according to a market watcher who did not wish to be identified. “The heads of financial groups may feel under pressure as a result of (resistance from labor), and they want to keep their relationship smooth through their executive terms.”Despite the growing calls for worker representation inside bank unions, it is unlikely that it will become a public issue.　A full-scale strike is extremely rare in Korea’s financial sector, where the average salary is higher compared with other industries. Like unions in most big corporations, bank unions are often derided as “aristocratic,” and their perceived focus is on securing generous conditions for older workers at the expense of younger employees.Despite a slew of criticism, many bank employees believe the union represents the stance of the majority in the sector, where the work culture is considered “conservative, hierarchical and rigid,” thus creating a stressful environment for its employees. “Top officials at every branch across the nation are union members,” an official at KB Kookmin Bank said, requesting anonymity. ‘The unions in the banking sector are strong compared to other industries, including the IT sector, because despite the wave of digitalization, it still requires employees to operate the system,” the official added.

2020.02.10.	코리아헤럴드	Korea’s capital market full of opportunities: FSC chief	FSC Chairman Eun Sung-soo delivers an opening speech at the 2020 Luncheon Meeting with CEOs of Foreign Financial Companies in Yeouido, western Seoul, on Monday. (Yonhap)Giving the thumbs-up to South Korea’s capital market which is undergoing continuous reforms, the nation’s top financial regulator said Monday that foreign investors can discover fresh opportunities here.“Expanding cooperation with startups such as fintech firms, invigorating the asset management market by converting capital flow to corporates and keeping the growth of the pension funds will benefit investors immensely,” Financial Services Commission Chairman Eun Sung-soo said at the 2020 Luncheon Meeting with CEOs of Foreign Financial Companies in Seoul. 　The meeting was attended by officials from the FSC, watchdog Financial Supervisory Service and Yoo Kwang-yeol, head of the Financial Hub Center, along with top executives of 17 foreign banks, brokerages and asset management firms based in Korea, according to the FSC. The Financial Hub Center, or Fn Hub Korea, is a center under the FSS that aids the launch and expansion of foreign financial institutions here. The key agenda of the meeting was to discuss countermeasures to tackle recent changes and growing uncertainties in the global financial environment, the FSC said. The financial authorities also addressed the main issues surrounding the government’s latest financial policies and establishment of financial centers here. As of end-2019, 163 overseas financial institutions were either operating a subsidiary or branch in Korea. Of the total, 33 were US-based firms and three were from Canada. Institutions based in other Asian nations had the most number of branches or subsidiaries at 67 while European firms ranked No. 2 with 54.

2020.05.07.	코리아중앙데일리	Toss is making money, but it's not clear how much	Toss finally reported its first profit on a monthly basis in April, five years after it started as a peer-to-peer money transfer app.    But it declined to say how much it made.     Toss, which was developed by Viva Republica, said Thursday its sales has expanded by 35-fold over the past three years largely on commission income from partner businesses.    Its sales which stood at 3.4 billion won ($2.8 billion) in 2016 expanded to 118.7 billion won in 2019. It reports 17 million users as well.    It said 83 percent of the sales from last year was from business-to-business engagements. Toss introduces a diverse range of finance products, from credit cards to insurance, on its platform.      "Toss is expected to enter a growth trajectory as Korea’s finance industry has transitioned toward online and "untact" services this year with the shift expected to accelerate even more,” said Lee Seung-gun, founder and CEO of the fintech start-up.      “Toss, which started with a money transfer service, now offers more than 40 financial services.”    Toss is planning to expand its range of offerings. Viva Republica received a preliminary approval from the financial authority in March to establish its own brokerage house. The new service will start under the name Toss Securities in the latter half of the year.      It is also planning to open an internet-only bank next year, going head-to-head with K bank and Kakao Bank.      "Through profit secured from the Toss platform, the company will further support the internet-only bank, brokerage and payment gateway businesses," Lee said.

2020.01.23.	코리아헤럴드	[News Focus] What will happen at Hanjin KAL’s March shareholders meeting?	Eyes on KCGI, Bando Construction, Kakao to see if they back Cho Won-tae or Cho Hyun-ahHanjin Group Chairman Cho Won-tae (left) and former Korean Air Vice President Cho Hyun-ah (right) Korean AirSigns of a sibling feud have been hard to ignore recently at Hanjin KAL, the Hanjin Group holding company that owns the country’s flagship carrier Korean Air, ahead of a Hanjin KAL shareholders meeting slated for March.With tension brewing over the holding firm’s leadership, the March meeting is an important one for Hanjin Group Chairman Cho Won-tae, who assumed the top post in April last year after his father died of chronic lung disease. Shareholders will vote on whether to reappoint Cho as executive director of Hanjin KAL. Cho is also the president and CEO of Korean Air, the group’s main cash cow. For Cho to remain in his role at Korean Air after his tenure expires March 23, he needs at least 38 percent of all votes based on the 77.18 percent attendance rate at the previous shareholders meeting.Scenario No. 1If Cho Won-tae’s family joins forces and supports him, together they can retain control of Hanjin KAL: Cho’s elder sister, Hyun-ah, owns a 6.49 percent stake and his younger sister, Hyun-min, owns a 6.47 percent stake. Their mother, Lee Myung-hee, holds 5.31 percent and Won-tae’s stake amounts to 6.52 percent.Together with family members and executives in control of affiliated companies, as well as Delta Air Lines, which holds a 10 percent stake in Hanjin KAL and is a known supporter of Cho Won-tae, the current chairman’s support base could account for almost 40 percent of Hanjin KAL shares. But this scenario is not likely, according to industry watchers.On Dec. 23, former Korean Air Vice President Cho Hyun-ah publicly accused her brother of failing to heed their late father’s wishes and ensure the “harmonious, joint management” of the company.The same week, media outlets reported that Cho Won-tae visited his mother on Christmas Day and a fight ensued over unspecified differences.Cho Won-tae vs. Cho Hyun-ahCho Hyun-ah, the infamous “nut rage” heiress, stepped back from management in 2018 after she and her sister found themselves at the center of a series of power abuse scandals.In Hanjin KAL’s latest executive reshuffle in November, it was highly anticipated that Hyun-ah would return to take control of the KAL Hotel Network, but she was not on the list.In a statement released to reporters via a law firm in December, Hyun-ah said, “Cho Won-tae’s business management of Hanjin Group is different from the late chairman’s instructions for harmonious, joint management.” He “continues to delay and insincerely respond to family discussions,” she added.She also said she would seek to resolve the issue by consulting with shareholders.Hanjin Group immediately released its own statement, saying the latest development should not negatively impact the group’s plans to normalize business.Rumors have circulated since last year that Hyun-ah and Won-tae are in a dispute over succession plans, including who should inherit their father’s shares.Some market insiders have suggested Hyun-ah has formed an alliance with her younger sister and their mother against her brother, giving her team a combined stake of 18.27 percent -- slightly more than the Won-tae-Delta team, which owns 16.52 percent altogether. If so, the decision is in the hands of the holding entity’s largest shareholder, Korea Corporate Governance Improvement, and its No. 3 shareholder, Bando Construction. Scenario No. 2Local activist fund KCGI is the biggest shareholder in Hanjin KAL, with a stake of 17.29 percent. Next are Delta Air Lines (10 percent), midsized construction firm Bando Construction (8.28 percent) and the National Pension Service (4.11 percent). Earlier this month, Hyun-ah reportedly met with the KCGI chief and officials from Bando ahead of a shareholders meeting, possibly about cooperating to oppose her brother’s reappointment.Combined, the KCGI and Bando shares amount to a 31.98 percent stake in the company.But industry insiders liken such an alliance to a poisoned chalice, since each individual member of the owner family holds a stake in the company of only about 5-6 percent, which would give KCGI the upper hand in governance.KCGI has become increasingly vocal in its initiatives to improve governance in recent years, having gradually upped its shares in Hanjin KAL last year from 15.98 percent to the current 17.29 percent. The activist fund has also consistently called on Hanjin KAL to sell off its hotel business to effectively reduce its 800 percent debt ratio. The hotel industry is Hyun-ah’s main area of expertise. Whether Bando Construction would support Hyun-ah remains unclear as well, as Bando Construction Chairman Kwon Hong-sa was a close friend of the late Hanjin Group Chairman Cho Yang-ho. Scenario No. 3When the country’s mobile messaging app operator Kakao acquired a 1 percent stake in Hanjin KAL for 20 billion won in December last year, the situation became even more complicated. Kakao said the acquisition was in line with a memorandum of understanding it inked with Hanjin KAL on Dec. 5, resolving to collaborate in areas including membership, fintech, commerce and content. On the day it was signed, Korean Air explained that the memorandum reflected Chairman Cho Won-tae’s determination to reinforce the IT aspects of the business, which led to market speculation that Kakao may be among his allies.The app operator has not commented on whether it plans to exercise its voting rights or buy an additional stake.Deja vu?Family wars over control of the company are nothing new for Hanjin KAL.After Hanjin Group founder and then-Chairman Cho Choong-hoon passed away in 2002, his eldest son, Cho Yang-ho, succeeded him in accordance with the terms of his will. But the founder’s second son, Nam-ho, and his fourth son, Chung-ho, sued Yang-ho, accusing him of misrepresenting their father’s dying wishes. This led the brothers to split the group and take control of different subsidiaries. The eldest, Yang-ho, took Korean Air; the second, Nam-ho, took Hanjin Heavy Industries; the third, Su-ho, took Hanjin Shipping; and the fourth, Jung-ho, took Meritz Capital. GS Group was created in an amicable divorce with LG Group in 2004 under an agreement among members of the conglomerate’s founding family. But market insiders say they doubt the Cho siblings will take the same path.They say it is risky to separate affiliates and that Hanjin Group is nothing without its main cash cow, Korean Air. “It is physically difficult for Hanjin Group to separate its subsidiaries, not only because the owner family mutually owns some stakes in each company, but also the group’s other arms such as its hotel, tourism and leisure businesses are closely related to Korean Air,” said professor of business Kim Kang-sik from Korea Aerospace University, adding that the separation of Hanjin Group’s affiliated companies would neither be profitable nor promising.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=044&aid=0000215073
2020.04.27.	이코노미스트	정유신 서강대 기술경영대학원장 겸 핀테크 지원센터장 “핀테크에 비금융산업 융합해 시너지 극대화 해야”	정유신 핀테크 지원센터장은 “한국은 지금 금융혁신 4단계 중 빅데이터를 활용하는 3단계로 막 진입한 수준”이라고 말했다. / 사진:김경빈 기자디지털라이제이션(Digitalization)이 가속화하고 있다. 글로벌 시장조사 업체 가트너는 디지털라이제이션에 대해 ‘비즈니스 모델을 변화시키는 디지털기술의 활용, 그리고 그것을 통해 새로운 수익과 가치를 제공하는 비즈니스로 이동하는 과정’이라고 설명한다. 그 최전방에 위치한 산업 분야 중 하나가 금융이다. 모바일과 디지털 기기를 이용해 본격적인 핀테크(fintech) 시대로 진입하고 있다. 핀테크는 이름 그대로 ‘금융(finance)’과 ‘기술(technology)’이 결합한 서비스 또는 그런 서비스를 하는 회사를 가리킨다. 간편 송금을 경쟁력으로 성장한 ‘토스’는 기업가치 1조원을 웃도는 유니콘으로 성장했다. ‘어린 토스’로 불리는 유니콘 후보들도 펀딩, 보험, P2P, 자산관리 등 저마다의 강점을 무기로 덩치를 키우고 있다. 과거 이런 서비스를 한데 묶어 ‘패키지’로 제공하던 대형 은행들도 살아남기 위해 애쓰는 중이다. 덩치를 줄이거나 서비스를 세분화해 새로운 활로를 찾고 있다.  그렇다면 한국은 본격적인 핀테크 시대를 맞이한 것일까. 정유신 서강대 기술경영대학원장 겸 핀테크 지원센터장은 이코노미스트와의 인터뷰에서 “한국은 지금 빅데이터를 활용하는 3단계로 막 진입한 수준”이라고 말했다. 금융혁신은 4단계로 나눌 수 있는데 그중 3단계 초기에 해당한다는 뜻이다. 정 센터장에 따르면 1단계는 언번들링(Unbundling: 분리) 시대이다. 과거 금융 소비자는 은행에서 송금, 대출, 자산관리 서비스 등을 한꺼번에 받았는데 핀테크 산업이 발달하면서 송금은 A사, 대출은 B사, 자산관리는 C사에 맡긴다는 것이다. 2단계는 디지털플랫폼이 발전하는 시기다. 토스나 카카오뱅크처럼 개별 서비스로 성장한 기업들이 증권 등 다른 서비스로 영역을 넓히는 것을 예로 들 수 있다. 3단계는 빅데이터를 매개로 기술융합을 이루는 기간이다. 정유신 센터장은 “신용정보법 개정안 등 데이터 3법의 통과로 빅데이터를 활용한 기술 융합이 가능해졌다”고 말했다. 마지막은 금융과 비금융의 융합 단계다.한국 핀테크 성장 느린 건 ‘융합의 부재’ 탓핀테크가 무엇이냐는 질문에 정유신 센터장은 ‘간편 금융 서비스’라고 답했다. 간편 송금, 간편 결제, 간편 대출 등을 생각하면 이해하기 쉽다는 것이다. 그는 “직접 은행을 찾아가야 했던 과거와는 달리 이제는 스마트폰을 통해 은행이 내 손 안에 들어와 있다”며 “누구나 애플리케이션을 이용해 빠르고 편하게 전문적인 금융 서비스 이용할 수 있는데 이런 기술과 서비스를 핀테크로 볼 수 있다”고 말했다. 일각에서는 한국의 핀테크 시장 성장 속도가 더디다고 평가한다. 세계적으로 핀테크 시장이 빠르게 성장하고 있지만, 한국은 그렇지 못하다는 것이다. 미국의 ‘GAFA(구글ㆍ아마존ㆍ페이스북ㆍ애플)’, 중국의 ‘배트맨(바이두ㆍ알리바바ㆍ텐센트)’은 핀테크의 4단계 과정을 거쳐 초대형 글로벌 기업으로 성장했다. 반면 한국에서는 그런 기업이 나오지 못하고 있다.  정 센터장은 핀테크 산업을 키우기 위해 가장 필요한 조건 중 하나로는 ‘융합’과 ‘시너지’를 강조했다. 금융과 비금융 산업이 융합할 수 있는 발판을 마련해 주면 얼마든지 관련 기업이 성장할 수 있다는 것이다. 그가 주목해야 한다고 언급한 기업은 중국의 온라인보험업체 중안보험(中安保險)이다. 2015년 당(糖)을 체크하는 건강보험상품 ‘탕샤오베이’를 출시해 ‘세계 핀테크 톱100’ 기업에서 단숨에 1위로 뛰어올랐다. 탕샤오베이는 혈당측정기기를 통해 모은 빅데이터를 활용해 보험, 의료기기, 빅데이터, 병원산업 까지 다양한 수익 모델을 만들어냈다. “우리나라에서도 핀테크 기업이 다른 분야로 서비스 영역을 확장할 수 있어야 합니다.” 그는 한국에서 이런 기업이 나오지 못하는 이유로 ‘융합의 부재’를 지적했다. 정부 부처끼리 입장이 달라 규제가 따로 놀기 때문에 ‘탕샤오베이’처럼 여러 분야에서 동시에 서비스 할 수 있는 상품이 나오기 어렵다는 것이다.  그가 ‘융합’을 강조하는 이유는 하나다. 한국은 미국이나 중국만큼 시장 규모가 크지 않기 때문에 한 가지 서비스만 집중해서는 글로벌 기업을 키워낼 수 없다는 것이다. “만약 어느 업체가 간편 송금 서비스로만 미국이나 중국 1위에 올랐다면 그 자체로 경쟁력이 있다고 말할 수 있습니다. 얼마든지 전 세계 1위 기업으로 성장할 수 있어요. 하지만 한국에서는 내수 1위 기업이라고 해도 시장이 작기 때문에 성장하는 데 한계가 있습니다.” 융합 서비스를 할 수 있으면 이야기가 달라진다. 간편 송금으로만 1조원의 가치를 내는 기업이 빅데이터 관리나 제조업, 교육 서비스업 등 다양한 분야로 영역을 확장하면 수십 배 이상 가치를 만들어낼 수도 있다는 것이다. 기업이 덩치가 커져 ‘규모의 경제’를 실현하면 고정비용은 크게 늘지 않으면서 더 많은 이익을 낼 수 있어 경쟁력도 향상된다는 게 정 센터장의 설명이다.규제 장벽 낮추어 성장토대 만들어야정유신 센터장은 “핀테크라는 새로운 시장이 시작되는 시대에 기존 산업이 쳐놓은 장벽의 높이를 낮추는 게 중요하다”며 규제 완화의 필요성을 언급했다. 정 센터장은 “지금은 기존의 시스템들이 더 효과적이라고 판단할 수 있지만, 길게 봤을 때 핀테크라는 흐름을 따라갈 수밖에 없다”고 했다. 그는 “트랜드를 바꿀 수 없다면 규제 장벽을 낮추고 이 산업이 성장할 수 있도록 받아들이고 지원해야 한다”고 말했다.  그렇다면 규제는 필요 없는 것일까. 이에 대해서는 신중하게 판단해야 한다는 게 정 센터장의 설명이다. “규제 완화가 필요하지만 규제를 무조건 나쁜 것으로만 봐서는 안 된다”는 것이다. 그는 “정부가 특정 시장이나 산업을 규제한다는 것 자체가 그 산업을 ‘인정’한다고 해석할 수 있다”고 말했다. 하지만 미국이나 중국과 비교하면 한국에서 핀테크 산업에 대한 규제가 많은 것도 사실이다. 개인정보보호법, 정보통신망법, 신용정보법 등 데이터 3법 개정안이 국회 문턱을 넘는 데만 1년 넘게 걸렸다. 데이터 3법 개정안은 정보보호 소관 부처를 하나로 모아 중복 규제를 없애고 기업이 빅데이터를 폭넓게 활용할 수 있도록 하는 내용을 담고 있다.  이에 대해 정 센터장은 “한국은 미국이나 중국보다 인구가 적고 시장이 작다”며 “환경이 다른 만큼 규제에 대한 판단도 달라야 한다”고 말했다. “상대적으로 시장이 큰 미국과 중국에서는 핀테크가 사회에 끼치는 영향력이 전체 산업의 1%도 안 되기 때문에 부작용이 생겨도 얼마든지 관리할 수 있어요. 초기부터 엄격하게 규제하지 않아도 문제가 되지 않는다는 거죠. 하지만 경제 규모가 작은 우리나라에서는 핀테크 산업이 규제를 받지 않고 급속히 성장했다가 부작용이 생기면 커다란 사회 문제가 될 수 있어요.” 이 때문에 기존산업을 보호하는 장벽을 낮추면서도, 최소한의 규제를 통해 소비자를 보호하는 조화가 필요하다는 설명이다. 정 센터장은 “정부가 융합과 혁신을 통해 핀테크 산업이 다양한 영역으로 확장할 수 있도록 발판을 마련해야 한다”고 말했다.- 이병희 기자 yi.byeonghee@joongang.co.kr[정기구독] [콘텐트 구매]				[ⓒ 이코노미스트(jmagazine.joins.com) 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=243&aid=0000009929

2020.02.13.	매경닷컴	Kakao finishes 2019 with record earnings	South Korea’s largest messenger app operator Kakao Corp. reported record results last year, powered by roaring new businesses in taxi and mobile payment and steady revenue streams from its flagship messenger platform. Consolidated operating profit in the final quarter of 2019 surged to 79.4 billion won ($67.1 million) from 4.29 billion won a year earlier, according to the company’s earnings guidance released Thursday. Sales jumped 28.8 percent on year to 867.3 billion won. For the entire year, operating profit soared to 206.6 billion won from 72.9 billion won a year ago and revenue climbed 27.8 percent to 3.09 trillion won, both record highs. Kakao shares finished Thursday 4.07 percent higher at 179,000 won. The company attributed the stellar results to KakaoTalk messenger’s robust business model and strong profitability of new business ventures. Its platform division raked in sales of 440 billion won in the fourth quarter, a 47 percent increase from a year earlier.   Sales of new businesses surged 95 percent to 88.2 billion won, driving overall platform sales. Demand for its KakaoT Driver service shot up in the year-end as people hired designated drivers to take them home after drinking gatherings. Services of its taxi-hailing app KakaoT Blue also expanded in the final quarter. Its mobile payment service KakaoPay also saw a rise in transactions and increased returns in its financial products. KakaoTalk Biz sales rose 73 percent to 221.6 billion, thanks to the banner ad placements on its messenger app and record high ecommerce transactions. Portal sales edged up 3 percent to 134.2 billion won, helped by a seasonal bump-up in advertising.  Banner ads on KakaoTalk messenger [Photo provided by Kakao Corp.] The contents division delivered sales of 423.3 billion won in the final quarter, up 14 percent on year. Game content sales rose 6 percent to 105.9 billion, led by the October release of its new game, The Legendary Moonlight Scultor. Music content sales also gained 9 percent to 153.3 billion won. Revenue generated from paid contents fell 25 percent to 47.8 billion won due to changed accounting standards of its online comic platform Piccoma.

2020.05.19.	매경닷컴	Korean digital ID services rush to fill void after public security system is scrapped	[Photo by Maekyung DB] South Korea is finally chucking away its decades-old certified online ID security system, stoking a race among potential candidates to replace it.The country’s public certification system will meet its demise after 21 years of service once the revised Electronic Signature Act passes the National Assembly on Wednesday. The revised bill will eliminate barriers between public and private digital certificates, paving the way for more easy-to-use offerings from commercial players to take precedence.Korea’s public certification system was introduced in 1999 and has reigned as the country’s dominant security platform for online transactions despite the agonies it has caused many Koreans due to its endless identity checks and multiple cybersecurity downloads. Its complicated procedure has also prevented overseas nationals from purchasing Korean products. Three private services are candidates for replacement. One of the leading players is Korea’s largest messenger operator Kakao, which released its own digital authentication platform in June 2017.  [Photo by each company] In less than three years, Kakao’s security software has garnered 10 million users and has been adopted by 100 institutions, benefiting in large part from its popular messaging app KakaoTalk. All verifications take place on the app, helping to streamline the previously labyrinthine identification process. Another major program is Pass, an authentication service created by the country’s top three mobile carriers and a cybersecurity fintech firm Aton. Downloads topped 10 million earlier this year in just nine months of release and are expected to reach 18 million by the end of 2020, according to its operators. Its authentication is also quick and simple, requiring either a six-digit PIN number or biometric identification. Expiry date is three years, longer than the public certificate version. Last year, Tongyang Life Insurance became the first insurer in the country to adopt the Pass system, followed by Korea’s leading brokerage Mirae Asset Daewoo and mobile operator KT.  BankSign, a blockchain-based identification program by Korea’s major commercial lenders, is also rapidly gaining ground since its release in 2018.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=009&aid=0004577832
2020.02.12.	한국경제TV	전시에 ‘전문성’을 더하다…글로벌 전시회로 한발 더 다가선 SIMTOS2020	전시+컨퍼런스 연계한 MWC, CES, IFA. 콘펙스는 ‘글로벌 트랜드’나흘간 8개 컨퍼런스와 70여 세션 구성, “양과 질 모두 잡겠다”글로벌 정상급 전문가들의 강연 … “새로운 인사이트 제공할 것”세계 최대 규모 이동통신 전시회이자 모바일 올림픽이라 불리는 ‘MWC(Mobile World Congress)’, 역시 세계 최대 규모의 가전제품박람회 ‘CES(Consumer Electronics Show)’, 유럽 최대 디지털제품 전시회면서 MWC, CES와 함께 세계 3대 가전?정보통신(IT) 전시회로 꼽히는 ‘IFA(International Funkausstellung)’. 이 세 전시박람회의 공통된 특징은 무엇일까.세계 3대 IT 전시회도? … 컨퍼런스와 연계 개최하는 전시회들전시회와 연계해 수십, 수백 개의 컨퍼런스와 세미나가 동시에 열리는 대표적인 콘펙스(ConfEx)라는 점이다. 콘펙스란 ‘Conference’와 ‘Exhibition’의 합성어다. 컨퍼런스와 전시박람회를 동시에 여는 전시?컨벤션의 결합 행사를 의미하는 말로, 앞서 언급된 세계 3대 IT 전시회가 대표적인 콘펙스 행사에 해당한다. 이와 같이 콘펙스가 MICE(Meeting, Incentive tour, Convetion, Exhibition) 분야에서 새로운 모델로 주목받으면서 전 세계적인 추세를 이끌어내고 있다.전시회에 컨퍼런스를 연계해 긍정적인 평가를 받은 사례는 쉽게 찾을 수 있다. 세계 최대 핀테크 페스티벌인 SFF(Singapore FinTech Festival)는 헥셀레이터 프로그램을 활용해 젊으면서도 혁신적인 리더들을 한자리에 모았고, 그들의 아이디어를 컨퍼런스에서 발표하도록 해 전시회와 컨퍼런스의 질을 한 단계 높이는 데 성공했다. 한편 컨퍼런스 콘텐츠를 유료화하거나  컨퍼런스와 항공권, 숙박 등을 결합한 패키지 상품을 내놓으면서 전시회의 추가적인 수익을 창출을 꾀하기도 했다.국내에서는 지역 전시회들이 컨퍼런스를 활용해 부족한 인지도와 적은 규모 등 지역 행사로서의 단점을 극복하기도 했다. 정부도 이러한 추세에 발맞춰 지난해 발표한 ‘제4차 국제회의산업 육성 기본계획’에서 콘펙스에 대한 특별 지원을 언급했다.이처럼 전시회를 열어 바이어와 전시 참가업체를 모집해 단순한 비즈니스가 이뤄지도록 하는 것이 아닌, 좀 더 다양한 논의가 오가고 최신 트렌드를 한자리에 볼 수 있으면서도 보다 전문적인 행사로서 거듭나기 위한 방법으로 다수의 전시회들이 컨퍼런스와의 연계를 택하고 있다.전시회뿐만 아니라 축제를 비롯한 여러 행사들의 경계가 점차 모호해지고 새로운 시대 참관객들의 니즈에 맞춰 오락적 요소가 결합되면서 ‘콩그레스’, ‘페스티벌’, ‘엑스포’와 같은 이름으로 전시회를 개최하는 것도 비슷한 맥락이라고 볼 수 있다.올해 개최되는 SIMTOS2020 역시 이러한 흐름에 발맞춰 컨퍼런스 규모 확대에 힘을 싣고 있는 모습이다. 나흘간 70여개 세션으로 열리는 컨퍼런스는 국내에서도 쉽게 찾아볼 수 없는 규모인 데다, 역대급 연사진을 예고하면서 생산제조혁신에 따른 제조업의 새로운 패러다임의 변화를 제시하겠다고 나섰기 때문이다.참관객 눈과 귀 즐겁게 할 ‘SIMTOS2020’올해 3월 31일부터 4월 3일까지 SIMTOS와 함께 열리는 ‘국제생산제조혁신 컨퍼런스’는 올해 나흘 동안 8개 주제의 컨퍼런스 내 77개 세션, 17개 기조강연 등 역대 최대 규모를 예고했다. 부대행사가 아닌 또 하나의 메인행사로 여겨질 정도의 규모다. 전시에만 초점을 맞추는 것이 아닌 전시와 컨퍼런스, 양 행사에 모두 초점을 맞춰 대규모로 개최하는 것이 글로벌 트랜드인 만큼 이번 컨퍼런스의 양적?질적 확장에 많은 사람들의 관심이 쏠리고 있다.컨퍼런스 운영에 전문성을 더하기 위해 한국경제TV, 캐드앤그래픽스, 한국생산제조학회 등이 8개의 컨퍼런스를 나눠 기획 및 운영에 참여토록 했고, 강연장 역시 킨텍스 1전시장 그랜드볼룸과 킨텍스 2전시장 3층 회의실(301~308호)에서 나눠 열릴 예정이다.SIMTOS2020 국제생산제조혁신 컨퍼런스 관계자는 인터뷰에서 “매회 생산제조산업의 최신 트랜드와 기술들을 선보여 왔던 SIMTOS가 올해 참가업체와 참관객들을 한층 더 만족시키기 위해 눈으로 보는 ‘전시’에 귀로 듣는 ‘컨퍼런스’를 더해 새롭게 선보일 예정”이라며 “올해 열리는 국제생산제조혁신 컨퍼런스는 국내외 정상급 전문가들의 최신 정보를 반영한 강연으로 구성했다. 이를 바탕으로 생산제조 관계자들에게 새로운 인사이트(Insight)를 제공하는 최고의 기회를 제공할 계획”이라고 강조했다.컨퍼런스의 외?내연 확장과 함께 올해 개최되는 SIMTOS2020. 1984년 여의도에서 처음 개최됐던 SIMTOS가 오늘날 세계 4대 생산제조기술 전시회로 발전했듯, 지속적인 혁신을 거듭하고 있는 SIMTOS가 ‘국제생산제조혁신 컨퍼런스’라는 새로운 컨퍼런스 브랜드 자리잡기에 성공할지 주목된다.[작성자: SIMTOS2020 운영사무국, 마이스산업신문 김홍근 기자]▶ 네이버 홈에서 [한국경제TV] 채널 구독하기 [생방송보기]▶ 대한민국 재테크 총집결! - [증권 / 주식상담 / 부동산]ⓒ 한국경제TV, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=215&aid=0000847295
2020.01.27.	부산일보	[중앙로365] 경자년, ‘부산 금융 중심지’ 도약의 해 되길	정구열 유니스트 기술경영전문대학원  명예교수이제 구정도 지나 본격적으로 2020년이 시작됐다. 부산은 전통적으로 우리나라 제2의 도시다. 그러나 제2 도시 부산의 위상이 흔들린다. 인천이 2017년도에 GRDP(지역 내 GDP)에서 부산을 앞질렀을 때 부산 경제에 대한 위기감이 있었다. 다행히 2018년에는 부산이 국내 제2위 자리를 되찾았으나 미래 먹거리가 뚜렷하지 않다. 올해는 ‘부산 금융 중심지’가 혁신적으로 도약해 부산의 미래 먹거리를 주도했으면 한다.부산 금융 중심지의 도약을 위해선 우선 기존의 ‘패러다임’이 변해야 한다. 패러다임이란 말을 만든 과학 철학자, 토머스 쿤(Thomas Kuhn)은 ‘패러다임의 전환’이 과학 혁신을 주도한다고 했다. 부산 금융 중심지의 혁신적 도약은 바로 기존 ‘패러다임의 전환’에 있다 하겠다. 부산은 2009년 1월에 정부의 ‘동북아 금융허브 로드맵’에 따라 서울과 함께 금융 중심지로 지정됐다. 서울은 ‘종합 금융 중심지’, 부산은 ‘해양·파생 특화 금융 중심지’였다. 그동안 부산의 경우 문현동 일대 63층의 부산국제금융센터(BIFC) 건물이 랜드마크가 되었고, 한국자산관리공사, 한국예탁결제원, 한국거래소 등 30여 개 이상의 굵직한 금융기관들이 그곳에 들어섰다. 숙박·문화 시설 등의 지원 설비도 확충되고 있다.기존 틀 뛰어넘어야 도약 가능정보기술, 인공지능, 블록체인핵심 역량으로 패러다임 바꿔야부산, 이를 위해 컨트롤타워 절실추진 중 ‘국제금융진흥원’에 기대서둘러야 국제 금융 도시 꿈 이뤄그동안 ‘금융 단지’는 많이 구축했으나 아직 가시적 성과는 별로 없다. 그러나 지난 10년간 시대는 많이 변했다. 4차 산업혁명이란 말이 나온 지도 4년이 지났다. 4차 산업혁명은 그 후 빅 데이터 분석, 인공지능, 로봇공학, 사물인터넷, 무인 자동차, 3D 프린팅과 같은 혁신 기술들이 서로 얽히고 섞이면서 신성장동력을 만들어 내고 있다. 그리고 최근에는 ‘알파고’ 이후 AI(인공지능) 시대가 펼쳐지고 있다. AI가 앞으로 더 짧은 시간에 어떠한 변화를 가져올지는 예측하기도 힘들다. 이러한 기술 생태계의 급격한 변화 가운데 ‘부산 금융 중심지’는 아직 기존 틀의 연장 선상에서 머무는 것 같다. 얼마 전 금융위원장도 ‘지난 10년간 추진되어 온 금융 중심지 산업이 만족스러운 성과를 도출하는 데 한계가 있었다’ 고 지적했다.그동안 선박 금융, 해양 파생상품, 금융 집적지 구축에는 그런대로 성과도 있었다. 여기에 작년 7월 부산시가 ‘블록체인 규제 자유 특구지역’으로 지정됐다. 부산시는 이와 별도로 서면과 문현 지구를 ‘블록체인 및 핀테크 창업 촉구’지역으로 지정해 핀테크(Fintech)를 가미했다. 핀테크란 금융에 IT(정보기술) 등 첨단 기술을 활용한 것이다. 결제·송금, 대출, 자산 관리 등 전통적 금융의 디지털화라고 할 수 있다. 스마트폰을 이용해 계좌이체, 예·적금 가입, 대출 신청 같은 은행 업무를 처리할 수 있는 것이 대표적인 사례다. 핀테크 산업은 이미 런던, 뉴욕은 물론 중국도 정상에 가깝게 다가서 있다. 중국은 금융 산업이 낙후되자 이를 뛰어넘기 위해 핀테크 산업을 집중적으로 육성했다. 그래서 지금은 세계 10대 핀테크 도시 중 절반이 중국에 있다. 이제는 거리의 노점상도 모바일로 결제한다. 이처럼 중국은 기존 금융의 궤도를 넘어 핀테크로 퀀텀 점프를 했다. 하지만, 우리나라의 핀테크는 많은 규제로 인해 다른 나라에 뒤처지고 있다.최근에는 금융에 인공지능까지 가세했다. 한 컨설팅 회사는 인공지능으로 인한 금융의 ‘핵심 경쟁력’ 변화를 예측했다. 금융 자산의 규모, 고객 숫자 등의 규모 경제에서 AI·데이터 기반 확보, 로보어드바이저(Roboadvisor), 개인 금융 비서 ‘챗봇’ 등을 활용한 초 맞춤 고객서비스, 개인과 AI와의 협력 역량 등의 금융 산업으로 변모할 것이라는 전망이다. AI 만능 시대의 도래가 아닐 수 없다. 세계의 많은 산업이 시대의 변천에 따라 그 패러다임을 바꿔 왔다. 얼마 전 폐막한 ‘CES 2020(국제 전자제품 박람회)’에서 현대자동차도 완성 자동차 제조업체에서 ‘스마트 모빌리티 솔루션’ 기업으로 거듭나겠다고 선언했다. 하늘과 지상을 연결하는 ‘UAM(도심 항공 모빌리티)’을 포함, 차세대 ‘이동 서비스’의 플랫폼이 되겠다는 것이다. 자동차 회사의 개념을 바꾸는 대폭적인 패러다임의 전환이다.그동안 ‘몸 만들기’에 주력해 온 부산 금융 중심지는 이제는 미래를 향한 새로운 패러다임을 선택하고 그 ‘핵심 역량’을 키워 나가는 데 집중해야 한다. 어차피, 미래의 대세는 AI와 블록체인이다. AI와 블록체인은 항만 물류, 관광산업과도 연계될 수 있다. 부산 금융 중심지가 핀테크를 넘어 AI와 블록체인을 핵심 역량으로 하는 ‘테크핀(Techfin)’개념으로 나가야 할 것이다. 과거의 연장선이 아니라 미래 기술의 관점에서 금융을 선도해 나가야 할 것이다. 아이로니컬하게도 금융이 ‘탈 금융’ 해야 생존하는 시대가 됐다. 이를 위해서는 컨트롤타워도 필요하다. 그래서 현재 추진 중인 ‘국제금융진흥원’의 컨트롤타워 역할이 기대된다. 이제라도 서두르지 않으면 부산의 국제 금융 도시의 꿈은 더 멀어져만 갈 것이다.▶ 네이버에서 부산일보 구독하기 클릭!▶ '터치 부산' 앱 출시, 부산일보 지면을 내 손 안에!▶ 부산일보 홈 바로가기	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=110&oid=082&aid=0000976671

FIUM은 금융계의 화두인 핀테크(Fintech)의 F, 혁신(Innovation)의 I를 합친 조어다. ‘핀테크 혁신을 꽃피운다(Fium)’는 의미다.피움랩은 지난해 6월 지방금융권 최초로 설립해 1기 4개 사를 선발해 대구은행 제2본점 5층 전용공간에서 협업을 진행했다.피움랩 2기는 초기 창업 기업을 대상으로 한 ‘인큐베이터 트랙’과 새로운 금융 서비스 개발이나 모델을 생성하고자 하는 기존 스타트업 기업을 대상으로 하는 오픈이노베이션 트랙’두 분야로 나뉘어 모집한다.인큐베이터 트랙은 사업 개시일로부터 7년 이내의 초기 창업 기업이 빠른 성장을 할 수 있도록 사무공간을 무상으로 제공하고 입주기간 동안 전문 육성과정을 지원한다.오픈이노베이션 트랙은 제휴와 협업 중심이다. DGB금융그룹과 실제로 새로운 금융서비스를 개발하거나 사업모델을 만들고 싶은 스타트업에 전담인력 배치 및 개발 리소스 등을 제공하는 과정이다.신청접수는 DGB금융지주 홈페이지에서 서식 등을 내려 받아 작성한 뒤 24일까지 접수하면 된다. 서류심사, 면접 등을 거쳐 내달 5일쯤 최종 선발할 예정이다.김태오 회장은 “피움랩을 통해 스타트업의 창조적인 기업 환경을 조성하고 DGB금융그룹의 디지털 선진화에 기여할 수 있게 됐다”고 밝혔다.정광진 기자 kjcheong@hankookilbo.com ▶네이버에서 한국일보 뉴스를 받아보세요 ▶뉴'잼을 보면 뉴스가 재밌다 [뉴스레터 구독하기] ▶한국일보닷컴 바로가기	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=469&aid=0000463949
2020.02.13.	한국일보	[짜오! 베트남] 음식 이어 대리운전ㆍ스타트업도 베트남 차세대 한류	※국내 일간지 최초로 2017년 베트남 상주 특파원을 파견한 <한국일보>가 2020년 2월 부임한 2기 특파원을 통해 두 번째 인사(짜오)를 건넵니다. 베트남 사회 전반을 폭넓게 소개한 3년의 성과를 바탕으로, 급변하는 베트남의 오늘을 격주 목요일마다 전달합니다.베트남 내 한류 인식 조사 홈페이지 캡처베트남 한류(韓流)가 진화하고 있다. 드라마와 케이팝(K-pop)에 대한 열광도 여전하지만 음식 미용 등으로 보폭을 넓히더니 최근엔 베트남 현지 사회 변화와 밀접하게 연동하는 추세다. 베트남 정부의 강력한 음주 단속 정책에 힘입어 기지개를 켜는 대리운전업이 대표적이다.베트남 시장조사업체 큐앤미(Q&Me)가 지난해 5월 베트남인 917명을 대상으로 진행한 설문 결과에 따르면, 베트남인이 한국과 관련해 가장 먼저 떠올린 것은 의외로 한국 음식(42%)이었다. 한류의 시초인 케이팝은 2위(21%)였고, 영화와 미용이 각 10%대로 뒤를 이었다. 특히 미용 관련 기업은 한국 기업 인지도 조사에서 다수의 대기업을 제치고 세 곳이나 10위 안에 들었다.대한무역투자진흥공사(KOTRAㆍ코트라) 관계자는 “최근 몇 년간 베트남의 소득 수준이 높아지면서 중산층의 외식 소비가 급증해 이 같은 순위가 나타난 것”이라며 “한류 시장 전체 규모는 여전히 성장하고 있어 새로운 사업이 등장하면 언제든 현 순위를 바꿀 수 있다”고 설명했다.현지에선 요식업에 이은 차세대 한류로 대리운전 등 정보기술(IT)을 접목한 서비스를 꼽고 있다. 예상보다 강력한 음주운전단속법의 영향력이 사회 전반에 미치기 시작했지만, 현지 업체들은 폭증하게 될 대리운전 수요를 감당할 경험이나 능력이 없다는 것이다. VN익스프레스 등 베트남의 유력 매체들 역시 지난달 한국의 대리운전 문화와 운영 방식 등에 대한 상세한 기사를 연이어 내보내며 한국 기업의 진출 상황을 주시하고 있다. 핀테크(fintechㆍ금융기술)와 전자상거래 관련 스타트업 사업도 후보군이다. 베트남 정부는 이미 ‘혁신 스타트업 생태계 지원 제도’를 수립하고, 2018년 8억8,900만달러를 쏟아 부었다. 이는 전년 대비 3배 이상 증가한 수치며, 투자액은 올해도 지속적으로 늘어날 전망이다. 다만 자국 스타트업 사업의 35.3%가 여전히 식음료 분야에 머무르고 있어, 이 분야 스타트업 강국인 한국의 진출을 적극 유도하고 있다.코트라 관계자는 “베트남은 전세계 20위 안에 드는 스타트업 유망 국가지만 아직 사업 계획 수립이나 이행 능력은 낮은 편”이라며 “디지털 인프라 구축 경험 및 역량에 우위가 있는 한국 스타트업 기업에겐 베트남이 기회의 땅이 될 수 있다”고 말했다.하노이=정재호 특파원 next88@hankookilbo.com ▶네이버에서 한국일보 뉴스를 받아보세요 ▶뉴'잼을 보면 뉴스가 재밌다 [뉴스레터 구독하기] ▶한국일보닷컴 바로가기	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=469&aid=0000466524
2020.01.04.	edaily	[8]박정수 교수의 현미경 '스마트팩토리'	4차 산업혁명은 클릭 창조의 시대[박정수 성균관대 스마트팩토리 융합학과 겸임교수] 스마트팩토리는 4차 산업혁명과 인더스트리 4.0(Industry 4.0)이 몰고 온 과거와 전혀 다른 제조 산업의 혁신적인 변화로, 설계·개발, 제조 및 유통·물류 등 생산 공정과 공급망 관리(SCM)에 디지털 솔루션(Digital Solution)이 결합된 개인화 제조업(Personalized Manufacturing)이다.정보통신기술(ICT)을 적용하여 품질, 원가, 납기 (Quality, Cost, Delivery)를 새로운 패러다임 속에서 재정립하여 효율적으로 개인화된 고객(Personalized Order) 주문 대응력을 극대화하고, 궁극적으로는 생산성 향상과 고객만족도를 향상시키는 고객 맞춤 지능형 생산공장을 의미한다. 공장 내 설비와 기계에 사물 인터넷(IoT)를 설치하여 생산공정 데이터를 실시간으로 수집하고, 이를 분석해 목적된 바에 따라 스스로 제어할 수 있는 공장을 말한다. 그러므로 고객의 개성화와 다양화, 즉 개인화로 야기되는 고객 대응력을 극대화하기 위한 유연한 생산 체계(Flexible Production System)가 요구됨에 따라, 제조업 혁신 방안으로서 대두되고 있다.또한, 제조업은 공급 중심의 비즈니스 구조 속에서 새로운 제품과 서비스를 개발하거나, 이미 개인화된 다양화와 개성화로 야기된 이슈를 해결하기 위해 내부의 아이디어를 중심으로 혁신이 진행돼 왔다. 새로운 아이디어나 기술을 외부로부터 공급받는다 하더라도 외부에서 내부로의 일방향적인 폐쇄적 구조 내에서 받아들여졌고 내부 중심의 문제인식으로부터 시작된 4차 산업혁명에 대한 변화관리가 주관적인 가치 평가와 다소 편협된 시각으로 판단되어(아는 것이 병인 격) 시간이 지나면서 제조업 혁신과 발전에 한계성이 나타나고 있는 것도 사실이다. 이러한 한계는 정보통신기술(ICT, Information & Communication Technology)의 속도와 적용 범위, 그것이 가져올 파급효과 때문에 더욱 극명하게 나타나고 있다. 하지만, 혁신으로 세계를 선도하는 애플(Apple), 아마존(Amazon), 페이스북(Facebook) 구글(Google) 등의 기업은 플랫폼을 중심으로 기업 내부뿐만 아니라 외부로부터 제품과 서비스에 대한 피드백(Feedback)과 새롭고 다양한 아이디어를 공유하며 그 제품과 서비스에 대한 객관적인 가치 평가와 사용자 경험(UX, User Experience)을 토대로 혁신적인 제품과 서비스로 개인화된 고객(Personalized Customer)의 주문(Click Creation)을 끌어내는 전략으로 세상을 혁신하고 있다. 따라서 4차 산업혁명의 개방형 혁신은 플랫폼의 네트워크 효과로부터 나온다는 사실을 입증하고 있다.아래 그림을 보면 알 수 있듯이, 애플(Apple), 아마존(Amazon), 페이스북(Facebook) 구글(Google)은 하나의 플랫폼을 토대(土臺)로 정보통신 및 인프라(ICT & Infrastructure), 인공지능(A.I.), 하드웨어 (Hardware), 대화 및 메시지 서비스(Communication & Messaging), 디지털 미디어 및 엔터테인먼트(Digital Media & Entertainment), 커넥티드 카 및 e-모빌리티 (Connected Car & e-Mobility), 이커머스 및 유통(E-Commerce & Retail), 핀테크 및 결제(FinTech & Payment), 내비게이션 및 위치 서비스(Navigation & Location Services), 광고(Advertising) 등의 다양한 영역을 연결하여 새로운 영역을 개척해 나가면서 산업과 산업 간의 벽을 붕괴하고 있다. 이것이 바로 플랫폼의 파급력이다. 왜냐하면, 플랫폼은 기본적으로 네트워크 파워(Network Power)를 갖고 있기 때문이다. 또한, 플랫폼(Platform)은 대량생산 중심의 공급중심 경제(Supply Side Economies of Scale) 구조에서도 제품과 서비스의 가치가 증가하지만, 개인화(Personalization) 사회로 구분되는 4차 산업혁명 시대에는  그 제품과 서비스에 대한 맞춤형 사용자의 수가 늘어날수록 기하급수적으로 증가한다는 개념의 수요 경제(Demand Side Economies of Scale)로의 중심이동을 가능하게 하고있다. 그래서 4차 산업혁명 시대를 클릭 창조(Click Creation)의 시대라고 주장한다. 위 그림은 수요 경제란 수요자의 수가 늘어날수록 사용자들 간의 연결을 기하급수적으로 증가시킨다는 것을 보여주고 있다. 그리고, 이는 연결성이 강화된 네트워크의 효과로써 가능해진다. 사실 이러한 변화는 이미 우리 일상생활 속에 깊이 들어와 있다. 카카오톡을 예를 들어보자. 카카오톡을 사용하는 사용자들이 늘어날수록 카카오톡의 가치는 증가한다. 왜냐하면 메시지를 보낼 상대방이 있어야 카카오톡을 이용하는 것에 가치가 있기 때문이다. 즉, 사용자가 많아질수록 카카오톡을 통해 연결할 수 있는 경우의 수는 급증한다. 우리나라 스마트폰 사용자들 중 대부분이 이용하는 카카오톡은 플랫폼을 통해 카카오택시, 뉴스, 내비게이션, 대리운전 등의 다양한 서비스를 제공하고 있다. 즉, 메신저를 통한 가치창출뿐만 아니라 다양한 영역에서의 가치창출이 하나의 플랫폼 안에서 가능하다는 것을 의미한다.이와 같이 플랫폼의 네트워크 효과는 개방형 혁신을 가능하게 하고 있다. 개방형 혁신은 공급자가 사용자가 되고 사용자가 공급자가 되는 플랫폼 생태계(Platform Ecosystem)에서 가능하다. 그러므로, 기업은 기업이 제공하는 플랫폼에 사용자가 자유롭게 들어와서 함께 가치를 창출해나가고 이러한 과정 속에서 기업과 사용자가 동시에 성장해나가면서 하나의 제품과 하나의 서비스가 아닌 플랫폼 전체를 발전시켜 나가야만 한다. 그래서 4차 산업혁명 시대에서의 혁신은 플랫폼을 통한 개방형 혁신으로만 가능하다는 것을 인지해야 할 것이다. 그러므로 4차산업혁명 시대의 생존전략의 큰 틀은 플랫폼경쟁이며, 데이터관리  기술역량과 인적자원 역량이 핵심이다. 그래서 경험을 함께 공유하고 만들어가는 생태계 조성 역량이 지속가능 경영을 좌지우지할 것이며, 그래서 그것을 가능하게 하는 지능형 스마트 팩토리 플랫폼 구축이 시급하다.류성 (star@edaily.co.kr)네이버 홈에서 ‘이데일리’ 뉴스 [구독하기▶]꿀잼가득 [영상보기▶] , 청춘뉘우스~ [스냅타임▶]＜ⓒ종합 경제정보 미디어 이데일리 - 무단전재 & 재배포 금지＞	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=110&oid=018&aid=0004548698
2020.03.12.	매경닷컴	Kakao Bank swings to profit, K-Bank remains in limbo	[Photo provided by Kakao Bank] South Korea’s two online-only banks have shown a contrasting scoreboard in their third year, with Kakao Bank recording its first-ever profit and cash-strapped K-Bank failing to get off ground due to lack of funds.Kakao Bank, led by the country’s biggest chat operator Kakao Corp., said Wednesday its net profit last year totaled 13.7 billion won ($11.4 million), its first year in the black since its launch in July 2017. It swung to profit after logging a net loss of 104.5 billion won in 2017 and 21.0 billion won in 2018. As of the end of 2019, its assets totaled 22.7 trillion won, up 86 percent from a year earlier. Kakao said the strong results were largely driven by increased interest profit from new bank loans. As of December 2019, its outstanding loan balance was 14.88 trillion won compared with 9.08 trillion won a year ago. It now has 11.3 million customers, in a country of about 51 million. Commission fees and other non-interest income have also helped. Together with Korea Investment & Securities Co., Kakao in March 2019 launched a new service to help its customers open a securities service account. By December, the service topped 1.14 million accounts. For customers who have reached Kakao’s credit limit or have a low credit score, the bank has introduced a new loan service directing them to second-tier institutions such as savings banks and capital financing firms. Kakao Bank is readying to go public this year and intends to step up its aggressive marketing by raising new equity capital. It also plans to unveil innovative fintech offerings with Kakao, who gained the regulatory nod last December to become the bank’s biggest shareholder.   Earlier player K-Bank is stranded. Despite being the nation’s pioneering digital lender launched three months ahead of Kakao, it has been crippled by liquidity shortages as it failed to get the much-needed capital refueling amid legislative setbacks. Plans for the mobile carrier KT Corp. to raise its stake in K-Bank have been thwarted due to anti-trust investigations into the telecom giant. K-Bank’s hopes for recapitalization were again dashed earlier this month when the parliament failed to pass a revised bill that would have allowed a non-financial firm to own a majority stake of up to 34 percent in a bank even if it has records of anti-trust violations. With its plans to raise capital through a rights offering from KT shelved, it has not been able to offer loan services since April last year. K-Bank has 505.1 billion won in equity capital, compared with Kakao Bank’s 1.8 trillion won. In search of a breakthrough, the bank on Wednesday named former BC Card CEO Lee Mun-hwan as its new chief. Lee will serve a two-year term after gaining official approval from shareholders on March 31.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=009&aid=0004535061
2020.01.21.	매경닷컴	Korea to launch financial data exchange in March	South Korea will launch a financial data exchange in March to facilitate transactions of data between buyers and sellers of financial institutions, fintech firms, retailers and telcos.The Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced Tuesday that it will open the country’s first data exchange that will serve as a platform to match data providers and recipients as needed.The decision came about two weeks after the National Assembly passed three bills designed to ease regulations on the use of personal information.The data exchange, for example, will help retailers conduct a commercial district analysis service based on data about floating population and credit card transactions. Insurers can come up with cheaper insurance plans by collecting information on accidents and vehicle safety. Financial companies can strengthen their robo-advisor platform, an automated online wealth management service, based on ample corporate data and stock market information, according to the FSC.The FSC will soon come up with a guideline to give ground for supply and demand of financial data and attract financial firms to the exchange.It will also consider introducing a data voucher program to help set appropriate data prices and support data purchases.The legal foundation has been set up after the three data transaction-related bills were passed,” said an FSC official, adding efforts will be exerted to establish an innovative and safe open data exchange.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=009&aid=0004504430

'아데나소프트웨어'는 핀테크 기업들이 IT와 금융을 원활하게 통합할 수 있도록 지원하는 웹사이트 제작, 고객관리(CRM), 외환 거래, 트레이딩, 위험 관리 솔루션 등을 개발·공급하는 업체다.   28일 투자은행(IB) 업계에 따르면 아데나소프트웨어는 이달 한국투자증권과 기업공개(IPO) 대표주관사 계약을 체결하고, 연내 코스닥 상장을 추진키로 했다. 자금 조달을 통해 우수한 기술 인력을 확보하고, 해외 영업을 확대하기 위해서다.   아데나소프트웨어는 해외 외환 관련 기업, 페이먼트(지급서비스) 기업들을 대상으로 자체 개발 금융 소프트웨어를 공급한다. 영국, 스위스 등의 유동성 공급자(liquidity provider, LP) 30여개 업체, 해외 외환 선물사들에게 원활한 호가를 제공하는 역할이다. 이들 기업들의 회사 운영에 필요한 고객관리 프로그램, 리스크 관리 프로그램, 펀드매니저들이 필요로 하는 프로그램 등도 제공한다.   고객들이 대부분 해외인 만큼, 수익도 유럽, 북미, 아시아, 오세아니아 등 전세계 고객에서 나온다. 이에 힘입어 2017년 이후 영업수익 및 당기순이익은 연평균 350% 이상 성장했다.   아데나소프트웨어 관계자는 "안정적인 기술력을 인정한 기존 고객사의 추가 물량 확대와 신규 영업을 통한 추가 계획 확대, 글로벌 핀테크 산업의 성장세를 감안할 때, 향후에도 고성장세를 이루어낼 수 있다고 판단하고 있다"고 말했다.   현재 아데나소프트웨어의 기업가치는 지난해 프리IPO 투자유치를 통해 평가받은 약 1500억원을 훌쩍 넘은 것으로 보인다. 당시 최대주주인 정승우 대표는 보유한 보통주 약 132만주 가량을 재무적투자자(FI)들에게 약 390억원에 매각한 바 있다. 주당 2만9000원 수준 거래다.   투자에 참여한 투자자들로는 에이티넘인베스트먼트, 한국투자파트너스, 프리미어파트너스, 컴퍼니케이파트너스, 타임폴리오자산운용, 코너스톤에쿼티파트너스, 한국투자증권 등 7곳이 있다.   정 대표는 벤처캐피탈(VC) 출신으로 외환거래·페이먼트사에 대한 투자검토를 하면서 해당 업체들의 소프트웨어에 대한 수요를 확인하고 직접 회사를 설립했다.    ggg@fnnews.com 강구귀 기자   ▶ 헉! 소리나는 스!토리 뉴스 [헉스]▶ 클릭해, 뉴스 들어간다 [뉴스쿨]   ※ 저작권자 ⓒ 파이낸셜뉴스. 무단 전재-재배포 금지	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=014&aid=0004380488

According to sources from the business circle on Monday, Kakao acquired a 1 percent stake in Hanjin KAL at the end of last year at around 20 billion won ($17.1 million). Kakao said the stake acquisition came after signing a memorandum of understanding with Hanjin KAL last month to create synergy effect by extending cooperation in wide-ranging businesses between the two parties, and it has not decided whether to exercise voting rights or buy additional stake.The two companies inked the deal on Dec.5 to jointly develop and provide new services in various sectors including platform, membership, fintech, commerce, content and digitization with an aim to offer new value to customers.  [Photo provided by Kakao] Market watchers, however, speculated that the partnership would lead Kakao to serve as a ‘white knight’ for Hanjin Group Chairman Cho Won-tae. The nation’s transportation conglomerate that owns flag-carrier Korean Air Lines has been suffering from management feud by its family owners, after Cho Hyun-ah, the eldest of the late patriarch Cho Yang-ho, has officially taken on her brother Won-tae who was made the legal representative of the group following their father’s sudden death in April last year.Industry sources recently found that Hyun-ah has been in talks with KCGI, a local activist fund holding the second largest stake of 17.29 percent in Hanjin KAL, and Bando Engineering & Construction that owns the fourth largest stake of 8.28 percent, to muster support for the power struggle.An official from the Kakao, however, said the stake purchase was made just to strengthen business ties, and the company doesn’t want to involve in the management dispute.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=004&oid=009&aid=0004504235

[사진 제공 = DGB금융그룹] DGB금융그룹이 2011년 설립된 DGB사회공헌재단을 중심으로 지역 주민을 위한 다양한 사회공헌활동을 펼치고 있다. 특히 최근 신종 코로나바이러스 감염증(우한 폐렴)이 확산된 이후 DGB금융은 대구 지역 자활 근로자에게 마스크 2만장 상당의 비용을 전달했다. DGB금융은 금융 취약계층인 노인과 다문화 가정, 장애인을 위한 맞춤형 금융 교육 프로그램도 진행하고 있다.DGB금융은 대구은행 제2본점 한 층을 스타트업을 위해 무상 제공하고 있다. 지역 내 소외된 이웃을 위한 사회공헌 기부금 1억원도 마련됐다.DGB금융 계열사인 대구은행은 대한적십자사와 정기 무료 급식 봉사와 김장·연탄 사랑 나눔 등 다양한 활동을 진행하고 있다. 지난달 대한적십자사 대구지사에서는 지역 최초 사회공유가치기업 가입식이 진행됐다. 사회공유가치기업이란 인도주의로 지역 사회 공동체 형성에 도움을 준 기업을 의미한다. 대구은행은 대한적십자사 대구지사에 누적 금액 10억원 이상을 기부하며 이 지역 1호로 '10억 클럽 회원'으로 가입했다. DGB사회공헌재단은 재단 산하 사회적기업인 '꿈나무교육사업단'을 통해 DGB금융교육센터를 운영하고 있다. 이는 시민들의 금융 교육을 위해 힘쓰는 곳이다. 금융감독원 주최 '1사1교 금융교육' 프로그램이 대표적이다. 지역 벤처기업 지원에도 DGB금융은 적극적이다. 지난해 대구은행 제2본점에 대구연구개발특구 창업캠퍼스가 마련됐다. 대구연구개발특구 창업캠퍼스는 대구은행과 연구개발특구진흥재단이 협력해 구축된 곳으로 총 31개 기업이 입주해 있다. 대구은행은 기업 입주 공간과 부대 시설을 5년 동안 무상으로 제공하고 총 20억원을 출자했다.정보기술(IT) 벤처 기업 육성도 진행됐다. DGB금융은 지난해 6월 'DGB 피움 랩(FIUM LAB)'을 열었다. 피움은 핀테크(Fintech)의 'F'와 혁신(Innovation)의 'I'를 합한 말로 핀테크 혁신을 꽃피운다는 의미다. DGB금융 계열사와 스타트업이 협업해 핀테크 역량을 키우고 급변하는 디지털 금융 환경에 대응하기 위한 곳이다. DGB 피움 랩은 우선 향후 5년간 20개 기업에 20억원 규모를 직접 투자할 계획이다. 또 DGB금융은 지역 내 사회적기업을 후원하고 있다. 지난달 사회적 경제 스타트업의 가치를 높이기 위한 크라우드 펀딩 대회인 '더 비기닝 2020'을 열었다. 올해 최종 선정된 사회적 기업은 △지역 뮤지션을 발굴하는 '엠에스엔터테인먼트' △혼자 사는 노인의 고독사 예방을 다룬 '새벽수라상' △위기 청소년을 지운하는 '아트앤허그' △자해 충동 지원 프로그램을 제시한 '마음의 정원' 등 4곳이다. 이들 4개사는 장기 무이자·무담보로 대출 형식 기금과 상금을 받는다. 김태오 DGB금융 회장은 "대구은행은 사회적 경제 기업과 '사회적 금융 활성화를 위한 업무협약'을 맺고 여신 지원, 지분 투자, 수수료 감면, 물품 구매, 비금융 서비스 등 다방면으로 지원하고 있다"며 "앞으로도 지역사회 동반자 역할을 충실히 하겠다"고 말했다.

2020.01.08.	매경닷컴	Kakao Pay mobile users can choose to place spare cash in money market funds 알리페이처럼…카카오페이 충전잔액, MMF로 굴린다	[Pulse로 배우는 영작문-765] [영문뉴스 원문 바로가기]  카카오페이가 이달 중 한국판 '위어바오'를 출시한다. 위어바오는 중국 알리페이의 온라인 머니마켓펀드(MMF) 상품으로 중국인 3명 중 1명이 가입할 정도로 인기를 끌고 있다. 카카오페이는 새로운 서비스를 바탕으로 올해 '종합 금융플랫폼'으로 자리매김한다는 계획이다.Kakao Pay, mobile payment service under South Korea’s leading messenger app KakaoTalk, has teamed up with Baro Investment & Securities Co. to optimize idle cash management through digital investment, a service modeled after hugely successful Alipay’s Yu'E Bao in China.이진 카카오페이 COO(최고운영책임자·부사장)는 6일 경기도 판교 카카오페이 본사에서 매일경제와 만나 "금융 서비스를 강화하기 위해 조만간 바로투자증권과 손잡고 '카카오페이머니'를 업그레이드할 예정"이라며 "알리페이의 위어바오 같은 모델을 한국에서 실현하겠다"고 말했다.“We will work with Baro Investment & Securities to upgrade ‘Kakao Pay Money’ service to enhance our financial services,” Lee Jin, chief operating officer and vice president of Kakao Pay, said in an interview with Maeil Business Newspaper on Monday. “We will offer Yu’E Bao-like wealth management platform in Korea.”카카오페이가 벤치마킹한 위어바오는 중국 알리바바의 모바일 결제시스템인 알리페이가 운영하는 것으로, 모바일 쇼핑몰 '타오바오' 등에서 사용하고 남은 충전 잔액을 운용해 수익을 내는 MMF 상품이다.Yu’E Bao is an online spare cash management platform within the Alipay app, allowing Alipay users to conveniently transfer their spare cash into the money market fund. Users can enjoy seamless access to their MMF accounts through their Yu’E Bao accounts for online and offline purchases.알리바바가 톈훙자산운용과 손잡고 2013년 6월 처음 선보였다. 위어바오는 한때 연간 수익률 7%에 육박하며 중국인들에게 새로운 투자처로 떠올랐다. 특히 순용 수익률을 매일 모바일로 알려주면서 큰 인기를 끌었다. 월스트리트저널에 따르면 지난해 위어바오 가입자 수는 5억8000만명에 달한다. 중국 전체 인구 중 3분의 1이 넘는다. 이 상품 총자산은 1조1300억위안(약 190조원)에 달한다.Since its launch in 2013, Yu’E Bao has grown to become the world’s biggest money market fund, which once offered annualized returns of nearly 7 percent. The number of its service subscriptions recorded 580 million last year, meaning more than one out of three uses the platform for investment in China. Total assets under management on Yu’E Bao reach 1.13 trillion Chinese yuans ($162.3 billion).한국판 '위어바오'는 고객이 카카오페이에 맡긴 충전금을 바로투자증권 예탁계좌에 넣어 운용해 고객에게 수익을 제공하는 방식이다. 카카오페이는 곧 시범서비스에 돌입할 예정이다.Kakao Pay’s new service will also allow users to transfer their spare cash on their Kakao Pay account into a money market fund that will be launched and managed in partnership with Baro Investment & Securities. The company is planning to open trial service soon, according to Lee.이 부사장은 "시중은행 수시입출금예금 금리가 연 0.1~0.3% 미만 수준인 것과 달리 카카오페이 고객은 자유롭게 입출금하고 충전금에 대해 높은 혜택을 받을 수 있다"고 말했다. 고객 투자 성향에 따라 수익률은 달라질 전망이다. 계좌에 돈만 넣어두면 연 1% 수익이 제공된다.The new service customers will be able to enjoy much higher benefits, compared to other deposits on commercial banks with an average interest rate of 0.1-0.3 percent per year, said Lee. Estimated returns vary with investment type, but an annualized 1 percent yield is guaranteed if money is left on the account, according to the company.카카오페이가 이 같은 서비스를 내놓는 이유는 고객 선불충전금에 이자나 포인트를 지급하기 어려워졌기 때문이다. 법적으로 이자를 줄 수 없는 핀테크 업체들이 이자를 주면 유사 수신에 해당돼 관련 법에 따라 처벌받을 수 있다. 이번 서비스로 선불충전금 관련 소비자 보호 장치도 마련됐다. 그동안 간편송금•결제업체들은 일반 금융사와 달리 고객 돈을 어떻게 운용할지 가이드라인이 없어 소비자 보호 장치가 필요하다는 지적이 꾸준히 나왔다. 증권사 예수금은 한국증권금융에 예치돼 금융회사가 망하더라도 돈을 돌려받을 수 있다.In Korea, fintech firms are not allowed to offer interest on customers’ advance payment in accounts. With the new service, Kakao Pay now is able to prepare investment benefits as well as safety measures for customers’ money like financial institutions.당초 카카오페이는 바로투자증권을 인수한 뒤 이 서비스를 출시하는 안을 검토한 것으로 전해졌다. 하지만 금융위원회 대주주 적격성 심사로 증권사 인수가 지연되면서 우선 제휴 형태로 상품을 선보이는 것으로 보인다.Kakao Pay initially planned to take over Baro Investment & Securities to diversify its financial services but temporarily suspended the buyout plan due to the delayed review process for the acquisition by financial authorities.카카오페이는 올해 삼성화재와 손잡고 디지털손보업에도 진출한다. 이 부사장은 "그동안 고객들은 보험 상품 가입과 보험금 수령이 어려웠다"며 "카카오페이는 사용자 생활 위험에 밀착해 가입과 수령이 편리한 보험을 만들겠다"고 말했다. 카카오페이가 선보일 보험은 '미니 보험' 형태다.Separately, Kakao Pay is planning to enter the digital insurance market with release of so-called ‘mini’ insurance policies that have shorter coverage durations and smaller amounts insured than regular policies, this year in cooperation with Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance.미니 보험이 발달한 중국에선 항공 취소에 대비한 항공지연보험, 온라인 쇼핑몰 반송 때 배송비를 보장하는 반송보험 등이 인기다.Demand for mini products such as travel insurance and online shopping insurance are exploding across the globe thanks to the easier acceptance and collection. 지난해 카카오페이 거래액은 50조원을 훌쩍 넘을 것으로 예상된다. 2018년(20조원)보다 2배 이상 성장한 규모다.Yearly transaction volume on Kakao Pay last year is estimated to have surpassed 50 trillion won, more than doubling from 20 trillion won a year ago, according to market analysts.이 부사장은 "올해 목표는 카카오페이가 '3000만 선택, 국민의 금융 플랫폼'으로 거듭나는 것"이라며 "지불결제시장 1등 사업자가 되겠다"고 말했다.The company targets to secure 30 million in subscriptions to become the country’s No. 1 in the mobile payment service industry.◆Editor’s Pick - optimize: 최적화하다- idle: 놀고 있는, 유휴의(예: He never stayed idle for long / 그는 하릴없이 오래 쉬는 법이 없다)- model after: ~을 본떠서/따라 만든- wealth management: 자산 관리- spare: 남는, 여분의, 예비의(예: I'm afraid I haven't got any spare cash / 미안하지만 나도 수중에 여분의 현금이라곤 없다)- seamless: 끊김 없는, 막힘이 없는, 매끄러운- subscription: 구독, 가입- transfer: 옮기다, 이동하다, 이전하다, 이체하다- vary with: ~에 따라 다르다/변하다(예: The menu varies with the season / 메뉴는 계절별로 다릅니다)- advance payment: 선불금 (여기서는, 선불 충전금/충전액)- coverage duration: (보험의) 보장 기간- explode: 폭발하다, 폭발적으로 증가하다- acceptance and collection: 보험의 가입승인 및 보험금 수령▶기사공유하고 코인적립하세요 'M코인'▶네이버 메인에서 '매일경제'를 받아보세요 ▶뉴스레터 '매콤달콤' 구독[ⓒ 매일경제 & mk.co.kr, 무단전재 및 재배포 금지]	https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=009&aid=0004496425
